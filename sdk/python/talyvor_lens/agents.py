"""Agents — the workspace owner's side of Agent Wallets at Talyvor Lens.

Called with the owner's key (a workspace key with the keys or admin scope):
create an agent, fund its wallet from the workspace's LXC, issue the agent a
key of its own, and read its statement. The agent then calls through Lens
with that key, and every model call is charged to its wallet, within its
spending rules, before the provider is called.

They are Lens's REST routes under ``/v1/workspaces/{ws}/agents``, in the
client's workspace. A non-2xx answer raises :class:`AgentWalletError`
carrying Lens's status and message.
