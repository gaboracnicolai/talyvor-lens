# Agent cards (B19.12) — test mode only

Each agent can hold one virtual card, issued through Stripe Issuing. Lens approves or declines every
purchase made with it **in real time**, by the agent's spending rules (B19.2) and its balance. Every
purchase request, approved or declined, is written to the ledger.

Cards are **class RED** (B22): test money only until a licensed partner issues them. With a live Stripe
key Lens issues no card, and it declines any purchase made in live mode. A purchase is also paid only from
the workspace's **test-funded** credits (bought in Stripe test mode) until the operator clears cards for
real money; past them it is declined as class RED. See docs/wallet-capabilities.md.

## Turning it on (Stripe test mode)

1. In the Stripe Dashboard, switch to **test mode** and open **Issuing**. Stripe offers local Issuing to
   UK platforms, and UK cards are issued in GBP.
2. `LENS_STRIPE_SECRET_KEY` in `/etc/talyvor/lens.env` must be the **test** key (`sk_test_…`).
3. Issuing → settings → **real-time authorisations**: set the endpoint to
   `https://<lens host>/v1/agent-cards/authorizations`, then copy its signing secret into
   `LENS_STRIPE_ISSUING_WEBHOOK_SECRET` in `/etc/talyvor/lens.env`. This endpoint is separate from the
   billing webhook and has its own secret.
4. `LENS_STRIPE_ISSUING_CURRENCY` defaults to `gbp`, which is right for a UK platform.
5. Developers → Webhooks → the **billing** endpoint (`https://<lens host>/v1/billing/webhook`): add the
   events `issuing_authorization.updated` and `issuing_transaction.created`. They settle each purchase
   after it is approved (see below). Billing must be enabled for that endpoint to exist.
6. Restart Lens. It fetches the ECB reference rates at start and every three hours after that.

## Using it

The workspace's owner issues a card for an agent. The owner is the cardholder, because they answer for
the agent (B19.11):

```
POST /v1/workspaces/{ws}/agents/{agent}/card
{"first_name":"…","last_name":"…","email":"…","line1":"…","city":"London","postal_code":"…","country":"GB"}
```

To read the card and every authorisation on it, newest first:

```
GET /v1/workspaces/{ws}/agents/{agent}/card
```

To make a test purchase, use Dashboard → Issuing → the card → **Create test purchase**, or run
`stripe test_helpers issuing authorizations create --card ic_… --amount 2000`.

## What happens on each purchase

Stripe sends `issuing_authorization.request` and waits up to 2 seconds. Lens then does the following:

- **Pricing.** Lens converts the amount (in the card's currency) to USD at the day's ECB reference rate,
  meaning the latest rate published on or before the purchase date. The ECB publishes each currency per
  EUR, so the formula is USD = amount × (USD per EUR) ÷ (GBP per EUR), rounded up to the micro-dollar.
  The USD amount becomes LXC at the peg (1 LXC = $0.10).
- **Judging.** The agent's rules judge the purchase as a payment, under the agent's row lock: active
  hours, the limit per payment, the daily and monthly limits, pause, and the approval amount. A
  purchase above the approval amount is declined and files an approval. Once the owner approves it,
  the same purchase (same card, merchant and amount) goes through once. The agent's balance must also
  cover the purchase.
- **Recording.** Every request becomes one row of `agent_card_authorizations`, whether it was approved
  or declined, and even when the card is unknown to Lens. The row holds the reason and the ECB rate
  and date used. An approved purchase also writes, in the same transaction:
  - one `lxc_ledger` row of type `agent_card` off the workspace's balance;
  - one `agent_postings` entry of kind `card`.

  The agent's balance, the workspace's balance and the rules' day and month totals all count it.
- **Failures.** Anything that goes wrong after the signature is verified is answered as a decline,
  never an error. On an error, Stripe would fall back to its timeout setting, which may approve.

## What happens after a purchase (B19.25)

The approved amount debited from the agent is the purchase's **hold**. Stripe reports what becomes of it
on the billing webhook, and each event settles the hold as new rows (nothing is ever edited):

- **Capture** (`issuing_transaction.created`, type `capture`). The merchant takes the money. A capture at
  the held amount moves nothing. A capture above it debits the agent the difference (tips, fuel).
- **Close, reversal or expiry** (`issuing_authorization.updated`). What is still held goes back to the
  agent. A hold released in full is credited exactly what it debited, so a capture below the hold gets
  its difference back here. A partial reversal while the purchase is still pending gives back the part
  reversed.
- **Refund** (`issuing_transaction.created`, type `refund`). The agent is credited.

Every event that settles anything is one row of `agent_card_settlements` (append-only). When the balance
moves, the same transaction also writes an `lxc_ledger` row of type `agent_card` (+ credit, − debit) and
an `agent_postings` entry of kind `card`. Amounts are converted at the ECB rate on the purchase's row.
Captures and closes can arrive in either order and end on the same balance. A replayed event moves
nothing, and so does a live-mode one.

To try it, use the Stripe CLI's test helpers on an approved authorisation:
`stripe test_helpers issuing authorizations capture iauth_… --capture-amount 2300`, `… reverse iauth_…`,
or `stripe test_helpers issuing transactions refund ipi_… --refund-amount 500`.
