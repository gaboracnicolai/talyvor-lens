# Cash-out: credits back into money, behind a licensed partner

B22.9. A workspace's owner can ask to turn an agent's credits back into money in their bank account.

1. **Held.** The credits leave the agent at once and are held: out of the agent (`agent:<id>` → `cashout:<id>`
   in `agent_postings`) and out of the workspace's balance (an `lxc_ledger` row of type `agent_cash_out`), so
   neither the agent nor the workspace can spend them meanwhile.
2. **Submitted.** The request is handed to the cash-out partner, which pays the money — the credits' USD value
   at the LXC peg, `amount_uusd` — to the destination.
3. **Paid**, the held credits are gone for good (`cashout:<id>` → `cashed_out`). **Failed**, they go back to the
   agent and to the workspace's balance, test-funded as they left, with the partner's reason in `detail`.

Lens hands requests to the partner, and records its answers, on the agent schedules' tick.

## The partner

Lens is built against one partner-neutral interface, `economy.CashOutPartner`: `Pay` a cash-out (idempotent on
its id) and ask its `Status`. **The only implementation is the test partner, which pays nothing.** It reports
every payment paid, except to a destination starting `test-fail`, which it reports failed so the way back can
be seen. The real implementation waits for a licensed partner; `destination` is a label for the account,
because the partner, not Talyvor, holds the bank details.

## Class

Cash-out is class **RED** (`cash_out`, see [wallet capabilities](wallet-capabilities.md)). Until the operator
records a clearance it takes test-funded credits only, and a request of live money is refused naming the class.
The owner must be verified, and a paused agent cannot be cashed out.

Marketplace seller payouts through Stripe Connect (B20.5) are a different
thing and are unchanged.

## API

```
POST /v1/workspaces/{ws}/agents/{agent}/cash-outs   {"amount_ulxc": 40000000, "destination": "Business account ••1234"}
GET  /v1/workspaces/{ws}/cash-outs                  every cash-out: held, submitted, paid or failed
```

Only the workspace's owner or an admin may cash out, never an agent's own key.
