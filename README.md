# Talyvor Lens

**The gateway that enforces every wallet rule before the call.**

Talyvor gives every AI agent a wallet — a balance, spending rules, approvals, a card and a live
statement. Lens is the part that makes the rules hold. Each agent calls its models through Lens
with a key of its own, and Lens judges every request against that agent's wallet **before the
provider is called**: a request the rules refuse never reaches the provider, one above the
approval amount waits for a person, and every charge lands on the agent's statement.

Lens is an API. The wallet console is the Talyvor app ([app.talyvor.com](https://app.talyvor.com),
or self-host `talyvor-suite`); the Lens host itself serves only a small service page at `/` and
component health at `/status`.

## Agent wallet quickstart

Create an agent, fund it, give it rules and a key, let it call a model, read its statement.

You need a running Lens whose workspace holds some credit: [Quick start](#quick-start-2-commands)
below, then steps 3–4 of [docs/quickstart.md](docs/quickstart.md) (the admin key and the
workspace's first LXC). These calls use that admin key, `LENS_API_KEY`, which is why step 1 names
the agent's owner; signed in to the app as the workspace's owner, the same calls run on your
session and the agent is yours.

Amounts are in µLXC: 1 LXC = 1,000,000 µLXC = $0.10, so $1 is `10000000`.

```bash
export LENS=http://localhost:8080
export WS=default

# 1. Create the agent. Every agent has an owner: the person answerable for what it spends.
AGENT=$(curl -s -X POST $LENS/v1/workspaces/$WS/agents \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $LENS_API_KEY" -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"name":"researcher","owner_user_id":"you@example.com"}' | jq -r .id)

# 2. Fund it: $2 of the workspace's credit moves into the agent's wallet.
curl -s -X POST $LENS/v1/workspaces/$WS/agents/$AGENT/fund \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $LENS_API_KEY" -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"amount_ulxc":20000000}'
# → {"agent_id":"agt_…","balance_ulxc":20000000}

# 3. Give it rules: $0.50 a day, the small model only, and anything above $0.10 asks you first.
curl -s -X PUT $LENS/v1/workspaces/$WS/agents/$AGENT/rules \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $LENS_API_KEY" -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"daily_limit_ulxc":5000000,"approval_above_ulxc":1000000,"allowed_models":["gpt-4o-mini"]}'

# 4. Issue the agent its own key. It is shown once.
AGENT_KEY=$(curl -s -X POST $LENS/v1/workspaces/$WS/agents/$AGENT/keys \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $LENS_API_KEY" -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"name":"researcher key"}' | jq -r .key)

# 5. The agent calls its model through Lens, with its own key. Any OpenAI client works the same
#    way: change base_url to $LENS/v1/proxy/openai/v1 and use the agent's key.
curl -s $LENS/v1/proxy/openai/v1/chat/completions \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $AGENT_KEY" -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"model":"gpt-4o-mini","messages":[{"role":"user","content":"Hello!"}]}'

# 6. Read its statement: the funding, then every charge, newest first.
#    Add ?from=2026-10-01&to=2026-11-01&format=csv for a month an auditor can open.
curl -s $LENS/v1/workspaces/$WS/agents/$AGENT/statement \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $LENS_API_KEY"

# 7. The requests waiting for your approval.
curl -s $LENS/v1/workspaces/$WS/agents/approvals \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $LENS_API_KEY"
```

What Lens does with the agent's request in step 5, before the provider sees it:

| The agent's wallet says | Lens answers |
|---|---|
| within its rules and its balance | forwards it and charges the agent — buffered and streamed alike |
| a rule refuses it (`gpt-4o` here, or the day's $0.50 spent) | `403`, naming the rule. The provider is never called |
| it could cost more than `approval_above_ulxc` | `403`, naming the approval it filed. The owner approves it once (`POST /v1/workspaces/{wsID}/agents/approvals/{id}/approve`) and the retry goes through |
| its balance cannot cover it | `402` |

## What an agent's wallet holds

All under `/v1/workspaces/{wsID}/agents`. Moving money, creating agents and issuing keys take the
workspace's owner or an admin; reading takes any of the workspace's credentials.

| | | |
|---|---|---|
| **Balance** | fund and withdraw; a top-up that refills it below a floor | `/{id}/fund`, `/{id}/withdraw`, `/{id}/topup` |
| **Rules** | per request, per day, per month; an approval amount; allowed models, providers and marketplace listings; active hours in a timezone; pause on unusual spend | `/{id}/rules` |
| **Approvals** | approve or deny, signed with a passkey once the workspace has one, with a web push when one is filed | `/approvals`, `/approvals/{id}/approve`, `/approvals/{id}/deny` |
| **Payments** | agent to agent, scheduled payments, requests, escrow | `/{id}/pay`, `/{id}/schedules` — [transfers](docs/agent-transfers.md), [escrow](docs/escrow.md) |
| **Card** | a virtual card whose every purchase Lens approves or declines by the agent's rules (test mode) | `/{id}/card` — [agent cards](docs/agent-cards.md) |
| **Pots** | credits set aside as a goal, a budget or a reserve, lockable until a date | `/{id}/pots` — [pots](docs/agent-pots.md) |
| **Statement** | one agent's, or every wallet in the workspace, for any period, JSON or CSV | `/{id}/statement`, `/statement` |
| **Controls** | unusual-spend alerts, pause one agent or all of them, the month-end forecast | `/alerts`, `/{id}/pause`, `/pause-all`, `/forecast` |

The routes are listed with their bodies at the top of
[`cmd/lens/agent_accounts_handler.go`](cmd/lens/agent_accounts_handler.go).

## The gateway underneath

Under the wallet, Lens is a drop-in gateway, and it also cuts what each call costs: an exact and
semantic response cache, opt-in cross-tenant reuse of cached answers (pooling), cross-provider
routing, and document distillation. **We do not publish a headline savings percentage, because we
have not finished measuring one** — see
[What we can and cannot tell you about savings](#what-we-can-and-cannot-tell-you-about-savings).

Drop-in replacement for OpenAI, Anthropic, Google Gemini, AWS Bedrock, Mistral, Groq, and vLLM. Change one URL. Get the wallet's rules, caching, routing, attribution, guardrails, audit, and fallback.

Comparison from public benchmarks and vendor docs. `make bench` reproduces the *latency and
allocation* figures on this page (it benchmarks the proxy against a mocked upstream); it does
not measure cost.

## What we can and cannot tell you about savings

Every gateway in this category advertises a savings range. Ours used to say 60–80%. Nothing in
this repository computes that number, so it is gone rather than restated.

**The mechanisms are real and you can inspect each one:**

| Mechanism | What it avoids | Where |
|---|---|---|
| Exact cache (Redis) | The whole call, on a repeat request | `internal/cache` |
| Semantic cache (pgvector) | The whole call, on a near-duplicate | `internal/cache/semantic.go` |
| Cross-tenant pooled reuse | The whole call, using another workspace's cached answer (opt-in, both sides) | `internal/cache_pooling` |
| Cross-provider routing | The price difference between a model you asked for and a cheaper one that measured equal on your traffic (opt-in per workspace) | `internal/routing` |
| Document distillation | Re-sending the same document as raw tokens | `internal/distill` |

**What we will not do is multiply a cache-hit rate by your bill and call it a saving.** How much
you actually save depends on how repetitive your traffic is and how well you were already
choosing models — and for a workload that is already tightly specified, the honest answer for
some of these mechanisms is close to zero.

### The baseline has to be an already-optimised one

This is the part most savings claims get wrong, including ours. **Providers now discount cached
input by roughly 90%** (Anthropic bills a cache read at 0.1× input; OpenAI at roughly 0.5× for
the GPT-4o generation). That discount is free — you get it whether or not Lens is in the path.

A percentage measured against naive, full-price, no-caching spend therefore **counts a discount
you already had as if we produced it**. Any figure we eventually publish will be measured against
a baseline that already includes provider-side caching.

Lens's own cost basis already works this way: `alerts.CostUSDDetailed` prices cached-input and
cache-write tokens at the provider's real multipliers (`catalog.withCacheRates`), and the rates
are deliberately set on the conservative side — where a provider's discount is steeper than we
model, we under-state it, so a savings figure derived from this basis errs low.

### Measuring it on your own traffic

**Your workspace's saving is measured, request by request.** Every spend row records what that
request would have cost at the model it asked for with no Talyvor cache — priced on the cache
breakdown the provider actually reported, so the discount above stays in the baseline — and what it
was charged. This month's sum of the difference is

```
GET /v1/workspaces/{wsID}/savings/current-month
```

and the app's Spend screen shows it as "Saved this month". It is those rows added up and nothing
else: no rate is multiplied and nothing is projected. A request served at the model it asked for saves
exactly zero; a cache hit saves the call it replaced, less what the hit was charged (priced flat on
the token estimate the hit itself is priced on — no provider call means no cache breakdown); a routed
request saves the price difference on the same tokens.

The routing path also records a per-request counterfactual: what the call cost, and what the model you
originally asked for would have cost. Admins can read the aggregate:

```
GET /v1/admin/routing-decisions/summary
```

It returns request volume, how often routing overrode your model choice, and the estimated cost
delta. **It is an estimate, not money** — the counterfactual call never happened, so its price is
modelled, not billed. Treat it as the shape of the effect on your traffic, not as an invoice.

`GET /v1/admin/usage/summary` gives the fleet's requests, tokens, provider cost, serves by source
(model, own cache, shared pool) and workspace counts over `?window=` (default 24h). Every admin
total leaves synthetic test workspaces out; add `?synthetic=only` to any of them to read the test
harness's traffic alone.

A published figure across customers — against an already-optimised baseline, on real workloads —
is intended. It is not in this README because it does not exist yet, and the point of this section
is that a number nobody computed should not be the first thing you read. Your own is the one above.

## Quick start (2 commands)

```bash
# 1. Copy the env template and fill in at least one provider key
cp .env.production.example .env

# 2. Bring up the full stack (Lens + Postgres + Redis + NATS)
docker compose up -d
```

Lens is now running at `http://localhost:8080`.

> **Image access:** `ghcr.io/gaboracnicolai/talyvor-lens` is a **private**
> package by decision — the binary embeds the full migration SQL (the
> pre-launch token-economy schema), so it is not published anonymously.
> Deploying hosts either authenticate once
> (`docker login ghcr.io -u <user>` with a PAT carrying `read:packages`)
> or build locally from a checkout (`docker compose build`, which the

Open `http://localhost:8080/` for the service page (what this host is, live health,
where to go next), or `http://localhost:8080/status` for per-component health.

The dashboard is a separate app — [app.talyvor.com](https://app.talyvor.com), or
self-host [`talyvor-suite`](https://github.com/gaboracnicolai/talyvor-suite). Lens
itself is an API and serves no account UI.

For a step-by-step walkthrough including issuing your first API key and making your first request, see [docs/quickstart.md](docs/quickstart.md).

## Connect your app (1 line change)

### Python — change only the `base_url`

```python
# Before
client = OpenAI(api_key="sk-...")

# After
client = OpenAI(
    base_url="http://localhost:8080/v1/proxy/openai/v1",
    api_key="tlv_your_lens_key",
)
```

### Python — using the native SDK (3 lines)

```python
from talyvor_lens import LensClient
client = LensClient(lens_url="http://localhost:8080", api_key="tlv_...")
response = client.openai.chat.completions.create(model="gpt-4o", messages=[...])
```

See [`sdk/python/README.md`](sdk/python/README.md) and [`sdk/typescript/README.md`](sdk/typescript/README.md).

### Other providers

| Provider | URL path |
|---|---|
| OpenAI | `/v1/proxy/openai/v1/chat/completions` |
| Anthropic | `/v1/proxy/anthropic/v1/messages` |
| Google Gemini | `/v1/proxy/google/*` |
| AWS Bedrock | `/v1/proxy/bedrock/*` |
| Mistral | `/v1/proxy/mistral/chat/completions` |
| Groq | `/v1/proxy/groq/chat/completions` |

## Seeing your data

Lens is an API: it serves no account UI of its own. These reads are all authenticated
API endpoints — point the dashboard app at them, or call them directly:

| | |
|---|---|
| Spend by model / workspace | `/v1/api/spend/summary`, `/v1/api/spend/by-model` |
| Cache hit rate + top patterns | `/v1/api/cache/stats`, `/v1/api/cache/top-patterns` |
| Per-model usage + serve source | `/v1/api/usage` |
| Circuit-breaker status | `/v1/api/alerts/circuits` |
| Local model availability | `/v1/api/local/status` |
| Live cost anomalies (`>3σ`) | `/v1/api/anomalies/scan` |

The dashboard is [app.talyvor.com](https://app.talyvor.com) (or self-hosted
[`talyvor-suite`](https://github.com/gaboracnicolai/talyvor-suite)), which holds your
key server-side and calls these for you. Unauthenticated, this host serves only `/`
(service page) and `/status` (component health).

## Migrating from another gateway

- **From Helicone** — see [docs/migrate-from-helicone.md](docs/migrate-from-helicone.md). One-line URL change; the `Helicone-Auth` and `Helicone-Property-*` headers keep working through the compatibility layer.
- **From LiteLLM** — see [docs/migrate-from-litellm.md](docs/migrate-from-litellm.md). One `base_url` flip; no Python supply-chain risk.

## SDKs

- Python: `pip install talyvor-lens` — [README](sdk/python/README.md)
- TypeScript: `npm install talyvor-lens` — [README](sdk/typescript/README.md)

## Operations

- Status page: `GET /status` (HTML) or `/status.json`.
- Health probe: `GET /healthz`.
- Audit export: `GET /v1/audit/export?format=json|csv|ndjson` (streams).
- Anomaly scan: `GET /v1/api/anomalies/scan`.
- Run benchmarks: `make bench`.

### Status

`/status` and `/status.json` are public and answer from a snapshot refreshed every 60 seconds. `/status.json` holds
exactly these fields, and no secret, reference id, error text, host name or workspace detail:

- `status`, `version`, `uptime_hours`, `updated_at`
- `components[]`: `name`, `status`, `latency_ms`, `measured`, `message` (a fixed phrase, when there is one), `checked_at`
- `providers[]`: `name`, `status`, `latency_ms`, `checked_at`
- `rails[]`: `service`, `name`, `mode`, `status`, `last_success`, `last_failure`, `capabilities[]` (`key`, `cleared`), and on
  the screening rail `lists_age_hours`: how many whole hours ago the sanctions lists last downloaded
- `rails_summary`: `up`, `down`, `idle`, `down_names`

A new field is added here and to `documentedKeys` in `internal/status/contract_test.go` together.

## Architecture

Single Go binary, no Python or Node runtime. PostgreSQL (with pgvector) for state, Redis for the hot exact cache + rate-limit ledger, NATS for the learner / anomaly event bus.

Test coverage: 88 of 92 Go packages carry tests, all green in CI (real-Postgres, `-race`). The
count in this line was stale at 37 for some time — it is now derived from the tree, so treat it
as accurate at the commit you are reading and re-derive with
`find . -name '*_test.go' | sed 's|/[^/]*$||' | sort -u | wc -l` if it matters to you.

[Business Source License 1.1](LICENSE) (BUSL-1.1). **Not an open-source licence today.**

You may read, modify and self-host Talyvor Lens, including in production, for your own
organisation's purposes without limit, and an integrator may run it for up to **three clients
at a time**, each on its own deployment. You may **not** run one deployment serving two or more
unrelated organisations. Beyond three concurrent client engagements, or for multi-tenant use,
that is a commercial licence rather than a refusal — `hello@talyvor.com`. See the `Additional Use Grant` in [LICENSE](LICENSE) for the exact

**The client SDKs are MIT, not BSL.** `sdk/typescript/` and `sdk/python/` are licensed under the
[MIT License](sdk/typescript/LICENSE) and are explicitly excluded from the Licensed Work above.
They are thin clients you embed in your own application and contain no Talyvor server logic, so
they should never put a licence review in the way of an integration.
