// provision_visibility_test.go — "fails closed" and "fails silently" are the same thing when
// nobody looks.
//
// Provisioning fails closed by design: no LENS_PROVISION_SECRET ⇒ POST /v1/provision is not
// registered ⇒ 404. That is the right posture — an unconfigured deployment must not expose an
// unauthenticated provisioning surface. But it is INVISIBLE. A Lens paired with a suite BFF that
// expects provisioning will boot clean, pass its healthcheck, serve every other route, and 404
// every login, with nothing anywhere saying why. That is a broken deploy wearing a green
// healthcheck.
//
// TWO GUARDS, one for each half of how that happens:
//
//  1. THE SECRET MUST REACH THE PROCESS. It was absent from docker-compose.yaml entirely, so
//     setting it in .env did nothing at all — the container never saw it. A config value the
//     compose file does not pass is indistinguishable, from inside, from one nobody set.
//  2. THE BOOT MUST SAY SO. When the secret is unset, run() logs a WARN naming the variable and
//     the consequence, so the one person who is looking — whoever is watching `docker compose
//     logs lens` during the deploy — sees it at the moment it matters.

// visible from outside, in the file that does the forwarding.
