// compose_env_reach_test.go — a config value the compose file does not forward is MUTE: it can be
// set in .env, look correct in every review, and never reach the process.
//
// This has now happened twice, both found by accident. LENS_PROVISION_SECRET was mute, so signup
// 404'd every login while Lens looked healthy. LENS_CACHE_POOLABLE_ENABLED was mute, which is the
// global gate on cross-tenant pooling — set it by hand, run the royalty test, see no mint, and
// there is no way to tell "not implemented" from "not switched on".
//
// WHY A TEST AND NOT A REVIEW HABIT. `.env` is NOT passed into containers. Compose reads it only
// for ${VAR} substitution inside the compose file itself, and this stack declares no `env_file:`
// anywhere — so a variable reaches the process if and only if it appears in a service's
// `environment:` list. Nothing about editing .env tells you that. The gap is invisible from
// inside the process (an unset variable and an unforwarded one are the same empty string), so no
// behavioural test can find it. It is only visible from outside, in the file that forwards.
//
// WHAT THIS GUARDS, AND WHAT IT DELIBERATELY DOES NOT. Lens's config reads ~160 LENS_* variables
// and compose forwards ~28. Most of the difference is fine: feature flags that default off and
// nobody wants on, tuning knobs with sane defaults, alternatives to values compose already sets a
// better way. Requiring all 160 would be noise, and noise is how a guard gets deleted.
//
// So the list below is not "everything", it is everything whose absence is SILENT AND COSTLY. The
// inclusion rule, written down so the next person can decide rather than guess:
//
//	A variable belongs in mustForward if being unable to set it would (a) leave money uncollected,
//	unmetered or unbounded, (b) leave a security control unarmed, or (c) make a shipped capability
//	inert with no error anywhere. "It has a safe default" is NOT an exemption when the default is
//	the off position of the thing you are deploying — that is exactly the pooling case.

// THE OTHER TWO SERVICES IN THIS FILE.
//
// ⚠ EVERYTHING ABOVE COVERS `lens:` ONLY, and that is a guard that READS as covering the file.
// docker-compose.yaml now runs three Talyvor binaries — lens, track and docs (#408 committed the
// track/track-migrate/docs blocks that had existed only on the server for twelve days). Track and
// Docs are DIFFERENT BINARIES from DIFFERENT REPOS, so their os.Getenv calls are invisible to the
// tree-walking enumeration above, and their undeclared variables went unnoticed for exactly the
// reason the Lens ones did.
//
// Measured on main before this change: DOCS_LENS_URL, DOCS_LENS_API_KEY, TRACK_LENS_URL and
// TRACK_LENS_API_KEY each appeared ZERO times. Docs' and Track's Lens integration has never been
// configured — third and fourth instances of the trap #406 closed for Lens.
//
// ⚠ WHY A DECLARED CONTRACT AND NOT CROSS-REPO ENUMERATION. The honest options were:
//
//	(a) walk ../talyvor-docs and ../talyvor-track for os.Getenv. Works on a developer's laptop
//	    with all three repos checked out as siblings. In CI it does NOT: this workflow checks out
//	    ONE repository, the others are not on disk, and a guard that silently no-ops when a path
//	    is missing is worse than no guard — it reports coverage it does not have.
//	(b) a git submodule or a vendored copy of their config. Real coupling and a new update
//	    burden, to read two constants.
//	(c) this: a small DECLARED contract per service, in this file, with the source line each
//	    entry was read from.
//
// (c) is chosen, and its weakness is stated rather than hidden: it is hand-maintained, which is
// the failure mode that produced this very bug. What makes it survivable is that it is SMALL and
// PINNED TO A CITATION — each entry names the file and line in the other repo it came from, so a
// reviewer can check it in one grep, and TestOtherServiceContractsCiteTheirSource fails if an
// entry has no citation. It is a contract, not a memory: if Docs renames a variable, this file is
// wrong in a way a person can see, rather than a test that quietly passes.
//
// ⚠ THIS IS NOT EQUIVALENT TO THE LENS GUARD ABOVE and must not be read as such. The Lens half
// cannot go stale because the code IS its input. This half can. It catches the failure that
// actually happened — a variable never declared at all — and not the failure where the other repo
