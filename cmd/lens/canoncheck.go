// `lens canoncheck` — W2.6 TIER-2 SEMANTIC CANONICAL FORM, MEASURED. It changes nothing and
// recommends nothing; it prints the two numbers W2.6 asks for and the one number W2.6 says comes
// before them.
//
// ⚠ THE ORDER IS THE ITEM'S, NOT A CONVENIENCE. "MEASURE THE SAME INPUT TWICE — if one prompt
// yields two canonical forms, the key is unstable and the whole design collapses. That measurement
// comes before anything else." So determinism runs first and is reported first: a collapse rate
// measured on an unstable key is a number about one sample, not about the product.
//
// ⚠ IT USES THE SAME LANE COMPOSITION AS cmd/hitrate — deliberately, byte for byte — so the
// numbers here sit beside W2.1's and W2.5's rather than beside a corpus of this file's own
// choosing. ENGINEERING danger is EngineeringDangerPairs + HeldOutDangerPairs; CONSUMER rephrase
// is RephrasePairs + ConsumerRephrasePairs; CONSUMER danger is ConsumerDangerPairs +
// ConsumerUnrelatedPairs.
//
// ⚠ AND IT REPORTS REJECTIONS AS THEIR OWN CLASS. A prompt the canonicaliser refused has NO key,
// so it cannot collapse — which flatters both numbers at once: the hit rate loses a pair it might
// have won, and the false-serve rate loses a pair it might have lost. Folding rejections into
// "did not collapse" would report a safety result that was really a coverage hole.
//
// ────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
// MEASURED 2026-08-10, claude-haiku-4-5, temperature 0, TWO INDEPENDENT FULL RUNS (2×592 calls).
// ────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
//
// ⚠ THE SAFETY HALF IS CLEAN AND IT IS THE ONLY HALF THAT IS: 0/44 ENGINEERING and 0/42 CONSUMER
// danger pairs collapsed, in BOTH runs, with 0 rejections — so the zero is a measurement and not a
// coverage hole. notice-direction produced DIFFERENT canonical forms both times, both runs
// ("How much notice must a tenant give their landlord?" against "How much notice must a landlord
// give a tenant?"), which is the named test W2.6 said the approach must pass.
//
// ⚠ AND THE UTILITY HALF IS 2/68, OF WHICH ONE IS NOT A REPHRASING. ENGINEERING 1/30 and CONSUMER
// 1/38 collapsed, identically in both runs. The ENGINEERING hit is `timeout-spacing` — "30s"
// against "30 s" — a TYPOGRAPHIC pair, the exact class W2.5 measured tier-1 folding against. So
// the tier-2 unlock delivers ONE genuine semantic rephrasing in 68 measured pairs: `capital-uk`.
// ⚠ AND IT IS NOT EVEN CONSISTENT ON THE TYPOGRAPHIC CLASS: `heap-spacing` ("512mb" against
// "512 mb") is the same shape and did NOT collapse — the canonicaliser reproduced both spellings
// verbatim.
//
// ⚠ THE MISSES ARE NOT NEAR MISSES, WHICH IS WHAT RULES OUT "TIGHTEN THE PROMPT". Of the 29 + 37
// rephrase pairs that did not collapse, ZERO differ by exactly one word. They differ by 2 to 13:
// "How do I center a div?" against "What is the best way to horizontally and vertically center an
// element in CSS?". The model is choosing among many equally canonical forms, and no instruction
// makes one of them inevitable.
//
// ⚠ THE KEY IS UNSTABLE AT TEMPERATURE 0 — 12/296 (4.1%) then 7/296 (2.4%) of prompts produced a
// DIFFERENT key when the SAME string was sent twice, seconds apart, to the same model. W2.6 named
// this as the measurement that comes before the others and the condition that collapses the
// design. What moves: "800mg" -> "800 mg" then "800 milligrams"; "v3" -> "version 3" then "v3";
// "UK" -> "United Kingdom" then "UK"; "How do I tie a tie?" -> "I" then "you". Every pair VERDICT
// happened to be identical across the two calls in both runs — but that is 2 collapses' worth of
// evidence, not a stability result, and an exact-key design has no similarity score to fall back
// on when the key moves.
//
// ⚠ COST — THE ITEM'S "~50 TOKENS" IS 3.8x LOW, because the fixed instruction rides on every call:
// measured mean 177.7 input + 14.1 output tokens per canonicalisation, against 40.8 input + ~180
// output for a real generation on the SAME model over the same corpus. On Haiku list ($1/M in,
// $5/M out — a published input, not a price this file sets) that is $0.000248 to canonicalise
// against $0.000944 to generate: 1:3.8 in money, not the 1:13 the output-token ratio suggests.
// ⚠ AND IT IS TWO CALLS PER LOOKUP unless the canonical form is cached by raw-prompt hash. ⚠ THE
// DENOMINATOR IS MEASURED ON HAIKU; production generation is a larger model, so the real ratio is
// more favourable than this and is NOT measured here.
//
// ⚠ WHAT IS NOT MEASURED, STATED RATHER THAN IMPLIED: one canonicaliser, one prompt, one model,
// one corpus. A different instruction may collapse more pairs — but it would have to close a 2-to-
// 13-word gap without touching the 86 danger pairs, and the 2.4-4.1% instability is a property of
// greedy decoding rather than of this instruction.
