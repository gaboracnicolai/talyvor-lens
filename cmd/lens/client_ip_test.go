// Client-IP resolution for THIS deployment: lens sits behind a containerised
// Caddy reverse proxy on the same Docker bridge (deploy/caddy/Caddyfile is a
// bare `reverse_proxy lens:8080`, so Caddy runs its defaults). Public traffic
// reaches lens only through Caddy — compose publishes caddy :80/:443, while
// lens publishes 127.0.0.1:8080 only, for SSH-tunnel admin.
//
// Verified empirically against caddy:2-alpine (v2.11.4), the image compose
// runs: with `trusted_proxies` unset, Caddy REPLACES X-Forwarded-For with the
// true TCP peer, discarding any client-supplied chain — but passes
// True-Client-IP and X-Real-IP through untouched. So XFF is the only header
// Caddy vouches for, and the RIGHTMOST entry is always the one it wrote.
//
// That makes True-Client-IP / X-Real-IP the live spoof vector, because chi's
// deprecated RealIP consulted them BEFORE XFF — bypassing Caddy's sanitising
// entirely. These tests pin that they are now inert, that a forged XFF cannot
// win even if a future `trusted_proxies` config makes Caddy append rather
// than replace, and that honest resolution still works.

// caddyHop drives a request through the production client-IP middleware
// exactly as run() wires it, simulating the Caddy hop: RemoteAddr is Caddy's
// container address on the Docker bridge, and headers are what lens receives
// after Caddy has forwarded. Returns the IP Lens resolves via clientIP.
