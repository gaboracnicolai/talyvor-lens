// chart_image_reach_test.go — the FIRST thing a self-host evaluator runs is `helm install`, and
// until this file existed the chart's default render named an image that does not exist. Both
// halves were wrong at once and they fail DIFFERENTLY, which is why one boolean would have hidden
// the defect:
//
//	ghcr.io/talyvor/talyvor-lens:0.1.0   -> token endpoint 403  (the ORG is not anonymously
//	                                       pullable — `talyvor` is not a GitHub org at all)
//	ghcr.io/gaboracnicolai/talyvor-lens:0.1.0 -> manifest 404   (the org is right and PUBLIC, that
//	                                       TAG was simply never published)
//
// So "fix the organisation" alone yields ImagePullBackOff just the same, one HTTP status later.
// That is the specific progress-shaped no-op this file exists to prevent, and it is assertion
// (3) below.
//
// ── WHY AN OFFLINE TEST AND NOT A REGISTRY PROBE ──────────────────────────────────────────────
// The obvious guard is "render the chart, resolve every image". It cannot live here. `helm` is
// installed in NO talyvor-lens CI job (checked all five: go vet · migrations · go test ·
// golangci-lint · govulncheck · build), and a registry call would make `go test` depend on GHCR
// being reachable. So the split is:
//
//   - THIS FILE, offline: cross-check values.yaml / Chart.yaml / deploy/k8s/manifests.yaml against
//     .github/workflows/images.yaml, the in-repo source of truth for what is actually published.
//     Drift in EITHER direction goes red.
//   - `deploy/helm/lens/check-image-reach.py`, by hand: the real anonymous-pull probe, kept the way
//     the suite keeps its site-parity premise. It carries its own both-directions controls.
//
// ── WHY THE ORG IS A HARDCODED LITERAL ────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
// NOTHING IN THIS REPO NAMES THE REAL OWNER. go.mod says `module github.com/talyvor/lens` — that
// is the Go import path and the aspirational brand, NOT the GHCR org, and it agrees with the very
// value that was broken. images.yaml gets the owner from `${{ github.repository_owner }}`, which
// only exists at Actions runtime. Deriving the expectation from any in-repo file would therefore
// compare the chart to something equally wrong, or to itself. The literal below was measured
// against the live registry (see the probe script), and assertion (2) keeps it honest by pinning
// the workflow mechanism that produces it.
const publishedImageRepo = "ghcr.io/gaboracnicolai/talyvor-lens"

// ── WHAT MAY APPEAR AS AN IMAGE IN values.yaml ────────────────────────────────────────────────
// Every image-bearing default is classified here, and assertion (5) requires the classification
// to match the file EXACTLY — a new image added without a row fails, and a row whose path
// disappears fails too. (A guard that only walks the file cannot see a deletion; a guard that only
// walks a pinned list cannot see an addition. This does both.)
//
// The inclusion rule, written down so the next person decides rather than guesses:
//
//	published        — this repo's CI builds and pushes it. MUST equal publishedImageRepo, and its
//	                   tag must be one images.yaml really publishes.
//	operatorSupplied — a PLACEHOLDER for a binary nothing in this repo publishes. MUST be
//	                   default-disabled, and MUST NOT sit under publishedImageRepo's org, because a
//	                   placeholder wearing the real org reads as something you can actually pull.
//	thirdParty       — someone else's image (postgres, pgbouncer). Not ours to publish or pin here.
