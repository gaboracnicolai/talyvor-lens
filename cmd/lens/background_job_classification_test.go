// background_job_classification_test.go — every background goroutine main.go starts, and whether
// running it on more than one replica is safe.
//
// main.go starts 45 goroutines. 35 are wrapped in `haComps.leader.Run(...)` — exactly one instance
// across the fleet — and the file already documents the other category in as many words ("NOT
// leader-gated: each replica must refresh its OWN cache"). ⚠ SO THE CODEBASE ALREADY KNOWS THERE
// ARE TWO BUCKETS. Nothing checked which bucket a given job was in, and a job added to the wrong
// one is invisible: it works perfectly on one replica and misbehaves only after a scale-out.
//
// ⚠ THE COUNT IS NOT THE FINDING AND WAS NEVER GOING TO BE. Nine of the ten ungated jobs are
// ungated CORRECTLY, and leader-gating any of them would be a bug — a per-replica cache that only
// the leader refreshed would serve every follower stale. Each is classified individually below with
// the property that makes it safe, because a census that reports "10 ungated jobs" as a defect is
// manufacturing one.
//
// THE PROPERTY THAT DECIDES IT, measured per job rather than argued from the schedule:
//
//	IN-PROCESS STATE     the work touches this replica's own memory. MUST be per-replica.
//	IDEMPOTENT           an age predicate or a row lock makes the Nth run affect nothing.
//	PER-REQUEST          started inside an HTTP handler; it belongs to no fleet-wide bucket.
//	SINGLETON            shared state, non-idempotent, or it costs money. Must be leader-gated.

// perReplica is every goroutine deliberately NOT leader-gated, with the measured property that
// makes running it on every replica correct. ⚠ A REASON HERE IS A CLAIM ABOUT CODE, not a label:
// each was read before being written down.
