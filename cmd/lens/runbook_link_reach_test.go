// runbook_link_reach_test.go — every `runbook_url` in deploy/observability/prometheus/alerts.yaml
// pointed at `https://github.com/talyvor/lens/...`, and all six 404. That link is the one thing an
// on-call engineer clicks at 3am with an alert firing, so a 404 there costs exactly the minutes it
// is most expensive to lose.
//
// ── WHAT WAS MEASURED, AND WHAT THAT MEASUREMENT FALSIFIED ────────────────────────────────────
// Census (not a sample) of all six, `curl -sIL -o /dev/null -w %{http_code}`, 2026-08-10:
//
//	https://github.com/talyvor/lens/blob/main/.../LensHighErrorRate.md              -> 404
//	https://github.com/gaboracnicolai/lens/blob/main/.../LensHighErrorRate.md       -> 404
//	https://github.com/gaboracnicolai/talyvor-lens/blob/main/.../LensHighErrorRate.md -> 200
//	https://github.com/gaboracnicolai/talyvor-lens/blob/main/.../NoSuchRunbook.md   -> 404
//
// The second row is the point. It was written down that "only the ORG is wrong" — it is not. The
// REPOSITORY NAME is wrong too: the repo is `talyvor-lens`, not `lens`. Correcting only the org
// yields another 404, one path segment later. That is the same progress-shaped no-op the chart's
// image reference had (see chart_image_reach_test.go), and assertion R1a below is what stops a
// half-correction from reading as a fix. The fourth row is the control in the other direction: the
// corrected prefix does NOT return 200 for an arbitrary filename, so the 200s above are the files
// and not a catch-all.
//
// ── WHY THE REAL REPO IS A HARDCODED LITERAL ──────────────────────────────────────────────────
// Nothing in this repo names it. `go.mod` says `module github.com/talyvor/lens` — the Go import
// path and the aspirational brand, which need not resolve and which agrees with the very value
// that was broken. Deriving the expectation from any in-repo file would compare the URL to
// something equally wrong, or to itself. The literal was measured against the live site above.
const runbookURLPrefix = "https://github.com/gaboracnicolai/talyvor-lens/blob/main/deploy/observability/runbooks/"

// The `talyvor` GitHub organisation does not exist — every URL under it 404s, measured above and
// again in deploy/observability/check-runbook-links.py. R2 below turns that measured fact into a
// repo-wide rule.
const deadOrgURLPrefix = "https://github.com/talyvor/"

// ── THE PINNED SET ────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
// A guard that only walks alerts.yaml cannot see a deletion: delete an alert and every remaining
// runbook_url still checks out. So the six are pinned here and assertion R1c requires the file's
// set to equal this list EXACTLY — an alert added without a row fails, and a row whose alert
// disappears fails too.

// the pinned six and each carries one link, and (d) each link names ITS OWN alert's runbook.
//
// The predicate for "this line is a link we ship" needs no exclusion list: a line whose first

// TestNoDeadOrgURLInShippedYAML is R2, the class rather than the instance.

// exist and every URL under it 404s.
//
// That rule needs no allowlist, and the three places `github.com/talyvor` legitimately survives
// fall outside it for a reason, not by name:
//
//   - go.mod's module path — not YAML, and a Go import path need not resolve over HTTP.
//   - scripts/w64-credential-leak-controls.py — Go import strings inside a control harness; no
//     `https://` scheme, so nothing there is a link.
//   - the explanatory comments #418 left in Chart.yaml and values.yaml — whole-line YAML comments.
//     One of them (Chart.yaml) quotes the broken URL *with* its scheme on purpose, to say what was
//     wrong. Comments are stripped before Helm or Prometheus ever sees the document, so they are
//     not clickable in the product. THE COMMENT RULE IS LOAD-BEARING, NOT DECORATION: delete the
