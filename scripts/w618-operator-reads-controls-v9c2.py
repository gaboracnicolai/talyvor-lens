"""w618-operator-reads-controls-v9c2.py — positive controls for the two ungated operator reads.

⚠ THIS ITEM MERGES NO FIX. The reads stay reachable by any tenant, because closing that means
gating a documented capability and that is Nicolai's decision (W6.18). So most of what is
merged is a RECORD, and a record that cannot fail is worth nothing — these controls are what
make it a tripwire instead of a note.

K1/K2 are the ones that matter: they put provider KEY MATERIAL on the response, once under its
own name and once renamed, and require the guard to catch both.

Rules, as in the earlier campaigns here: anchor count asserted before editing; a companion test
that must stay green; sha256 re-checked after revert.

Run from the repo root:  python3 scripts/w618-operator-reads-controls-v9c2.py
