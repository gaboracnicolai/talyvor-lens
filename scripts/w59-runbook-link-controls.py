"""w59-runbook-link-controls.py — positive controls for cmd/lens/runbook_link_reach_test.go.

A guard that passes on its first run is a guard nobody has proved can fail. These controls mutate
the tree one edit at a time and require the PREDICTED assertion to be the one that fires — not
merely "something went red", because a crash, a compile error and a real catch all look identical
in a list of test names.

Each control names its catcher as a falsifiable claim. A control caught by the *wrong* assertion is
recorded as a MISPREDICTION and is a finding about the guard, not about the product.

Run from the repo root:  python3 scripts/w59-runbook-link-controls.py
Exit 0 iff every control produced its predicted verdict.
