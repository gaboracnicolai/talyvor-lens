"""w610-public-node-discovery-controls-v9c2.py — the positive-control campaign for the
public node-discovery leak fix.

Every control is a MUTATION applied to the working tree, run, observed, and reverted. The three
rules this repo's earlier campaigns learned the hard way, enforced mechanically here:

  1. ASSERT THE ANCHOR COUNT BEFORE EDITING. A substitution that matches nothing edits zero bytes,
     and "the control did not apply" is byte-indistinguishable from "the guard caught it". Every
     control asserts its anchor occurs exactly once before it is allowed to run.

  2. EVERY CONTROL NAMES A TEST THAT MUST STAY GREEN. A mutation that breaks the build reds every
     test in the package, including the one the control claims to have tripped — so a control with
     no green companion cannot tell "caught" from "nothing compiled".

  3. RESTORE AND PROVE IT. Each file's sha256 is taken before the edit and re-checked after revert.

The real-Postgres controls (C9, C10) need LENS_TEST_DATABASE_URL; without it the tests they drive
SKIP, and a skip is reported as an UNARMED control rather than counted as a pass.
