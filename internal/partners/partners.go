// Package partners is every outside service money moves through, behind one partner-neutral interface each.
//
// B30.3. Lens never talks to a bank, broker, card network, insurer or verification service directly: it asks the
// interface here, and the Registry decides which implementation answers. Each interface has a Test
// implementation that moves no real money and answers deterministically, as Stripe's test cards do:
//
//   - an amount whose minor units end in 13 fails;
//   - an amount whose minor units end in 14 succeeds, then comes back (a payment returned, a fill busted, a claim
//     clawed back): the call reports it done, and every later status reports it returned;
//   - an amount whose minor units end in 15 stays pending, however often it is asked after;
//   - any other amount succeeds.
//
// What has no amount (opening an account, a verification check, an agent token) answers by the name it is given:
// a name containing TESTFAIL fails, TESTRETURN succeeds and is later withdrawn, TESTPENDING stays pending. A name
// containing TESTSANCTION screens as a hit, and fails a verification check.
//
// The Registry hands out the Test implementation unless the capability the money moves for has a live clearance
// AND a real adapter is configured — and there is no real adapter yet. Follows economy.CashOutPartner (B22.9).
//
// A Test implementation keeps what it was asked in memory, so a status or statement read from the same one sees
// it. Every call that moves money takes the caller's ID and is idempotent on it: asked again, it does nothing new
// and answers as it did the first time.
