// wallet_capabilities.go — B22.1: EVERY WALLET CAPABILITY CARRIES ITS CLASS, AND REAL MONEY OBEYS IT.
//
//	GREEN  real money now.
//	AMBER  test money; real money only once the lawyer confirms it.
//	RED    test money only, until a licence or a licensed partner exists.
//
// An AMBER or RED capability takes only test-funded money until the operator records a clearance for it
// (wallet_clearances, migration 0158: who, when, the lawyer's or partner's reference; 0194, B30.1: the licence,
// the licensed partner, the countries it covers and its expiry), and revoking the clearance stops live money
// again from the next use. A clearance past its expiry refuses live money exactly like no clearance, and so does a
// clearance used by an owner verified in a country it does not list (B30.10: the owner's country is the one their
// verification confirmed), naming that country. A GREEN capability takes any.
//
// Money reaches a capability two ways, and both are judged:
//
//   - credits: every credit lot carries its funding on its lxc_ledger row (metadata.funding: test, live,
//     grant or synthetic), and the test-funded part of a workspace's balance is lxc_balances.test_funded_ulxc.
//     An uncleared AMBER or RED spend takes it from there, or is refused. Every other spend takes the credits
//     that are not test-funded first (writeLXCBalance), so nothing but a gated spend uses test-funded credits
//     up while others remain.
//   - a Stripe bill (a payment to another company's agent is on the company's marketplace bill, B19.15): that
//     money is live when Lens's Stripe key is live (SetLiveStripe).
//
// Going live with Stripe therefore needs no code change to stay safe: a live key makes every new purchase
// live-funded and every bill live, and neither reaches an AMBER or RED capability without a clearance.
