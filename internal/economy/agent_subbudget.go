// agent_subbudget.go — F4-capstone step A: the per-scoped-key LXC sub-budget + the EXACTLY-ONCE agent debit.
// This is the substrate the closed-loop allocator (a later step) sits on. It MINTS NOTHING — it bounds and
// records SPENDING of already-existing LXC (workspace↔Talyvor pool), crediting no ledger and adding no mint
// type. CENTRAL-COUNTERPARTY + CLOSED-LOOP: LXC is debited from the workspace's lxc_balances via the SAME
// internals SpendLXC uses (readLXCBalance/insertLXCLedger/writeLXCBalance) — this file NEVER touches
// LedgerStore.Transfer (LENS P2P) or the marketplace (asserted by agent_subbudget_noloop_test.go).
//
// THE LOCK ORDER (B35.2). Every transaction that takes these rows takes them in this order, and only this order:
//
//  1. the request's own row: its lxc_reservations row (a hold inserts it; a settle or a release locks it), its
//     lxc_spend_claims row (a debit) or its agent_debit_settlements row (the debit's settle);
//  2. the key's agent_lxc_subbudgets row;
//  3. the agent's agent_accounts row (lockAgent), and with it the agent's stored balance and its company's
//     credit line;
//  4. the workspace's lxc_balances row (readLXCBalance).
//
// A step a transaction does not need is skipped, never reordered: an agent's funding, a move back to its
// workspace, a payment and every other agent movement take 3 then 4. Before B35.2 a settle and a release took 4 before 2 and 3 while a hold took 2, 3, 4,
// so a hold and a settle of one agent at the same moment deadlocked: Postgres cancelled one, a cancelled hold
// was refused with money in the wallet and a cancelled settle left the answer unbilled. The order makes that
// cycle impossible; retryLocks below runs again whatever Postgres still cancels.

// lockRetries is how many more times a hold, debit, settle or release runs after Postgres cancels it as a
// deadlock or a serialization failure. Each is idempotent under its reservation or request id, so running it
// again cannot hold or bill twice.
