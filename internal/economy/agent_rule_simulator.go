// agent_rule_simulator.go — B28.306: "WOULD THIS REQUEST PASS MY RULES?", ANSWERED WITHOUT MOVING MONEY.
//
// SimulateAgentRules judges a request the agent has not made — a question to a model, or a payment to a payee —
// with enforceAgentRules itself, the very judgement a hold or a debit makes, inside a transaction that is always
// rolled back. Whatever the judgement writes on the way (the payee ledger's row, an unusual-spend alert, a used
// approval) goes with it, so a simulation posts nothing, files no approval and pauses no one. The spend it counts
// is the agent's real spend so far. A licence to a listing (B32.22) is judged by the licence rules too.

// ErrBadSimulation: the simulated request cannot be judged as given.

// listing, or with Licence a licence to it (B32.22): its kind and licence, committing the agent to AmountULXC — and
// without one a question to Model through Provider.
