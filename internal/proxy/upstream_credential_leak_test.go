// upstream_credential_leak_test.go — THE CALLER'S TALYVOR CREDENTIAL MUST NOT REACH THE PROVIDER.
//
// forward copies EVERY inbound client header onto the upstream request (skipping only Host and
// Accept-Encoding) and then runs cfg.setAuth. The existing oracle forward_authheaders_test.go pins
// that the client's Authorization is overwritten — and its comment states that as a general property
// of the seam ("setAuth ... OVERWRITES the Authorization with the configured provider key").
//
// ⚠ THAT ORACLE DRIVES ONE PROVIDER. setAuth is a per-provider closure and only THREE of the eight
// shapes write Authorization at all: google's setAuth is an empty func (its key goes in the URL),
// vllm's is conditional on an operator key being configured, and bedrock's discards its own error
// when AWS credentials are absent. A property asserted on `openai` alone was read as holding for the
// switch.
//
// ⚠ AND AUTHORIZATION IS NOT THE ONLY CREDENTIAL HEADER. internal/auth accepts a Talyvor credential
// in THREE inbound locations (Authorization: Bearer, X-Talyvor-Key, X-API-Key) — extractCredential
// in manager.go and extractKey in middleware.go. No setAuth branch touches X-Talyvor-Key, and only
// anthropic's collides with X-API-Key. So the header a customer authenticates with is forwarded to
// the provider verbatim on every request that does not happen to reuse its name.
//
// The credential at stake is not junk. It is the caller's `tlv_` workspace key (spends their
// balance, mints keys for their workspace) or, via the X-API-Key legacy path, the GLOBAL admin key.
//
// WHAT THIS FILE ASSERTS, per provider shape: no inbound credential header value appears anywhere in
// what the upstream received — any header value, or the URL. Plus four floors, because a guard that
// can pass by measuring nothing is not a guard:
//   - the provider set is DERIVED from inference.ConfigFor's own switch and checked BOTH DIRECTIONS
//     against the table below, so a new provider fails until it is probed and a deleted one fails as
//     stale (a derived sweep cannot see what is no longer there);
//   - the credential-header set is DERIVED from internal/auth's two extractors and checked BOTH
//     DIRECTIONS, so a fourth credential location fails until it is classified;
//   - a benign client header must STILL arrive — "strip every header" would satisfy the leak
//     assertion and break the proxy;
//   - the configured provider credential must STILL arrive on every shape that has one — "strip the
//     credential headers and never re-add auth" would also satisfy it.

// credentialHeaders — the inbound header names internal/auth will accept a Talyvor credential in.
//
// PINNED BY HAND, and cross-checked against the source in TestCredentialHeaderSet_MatchesAuthSource.
// The pin exists because the derivation cannot see a deletion: if someone removes the X-API-Key
// branch from extractCredential the parse simply returns less, and a source-only guard would go
// quietly green over a narrower sweep.

//
// ⚠ WHY THIS EXISTS AND WHY IT IS NOT THE RunUpstream TABLE AGAIN. The first fix for this defect
// went in at proxy.forward and was INERT on every streamed request, because stream.go carries its
// OWN copy of the same loop and never touches RunUpstream. Two seams were found by reading a grep
// output; a third would be found by nobody. This enumerates the shape — a range that fills a header
// map — from the source, and refuses to pass on one that is not classified.
//
// A new entry here is not automatically a defect. It is a question: does this loop put an INBOUND
// request's headers onto an OUTBOUND one? If yes it must range over auth.StripCredentialHeaders.
