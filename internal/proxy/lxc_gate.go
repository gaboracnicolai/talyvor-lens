// lxc_gate.go — LXC GATING (Phase-2 Stage 2.4/2.5): the pre-serve check that
// BLOCKS a request (402) when the workspace's LXC balance can't cover the
// estimated cost. This is the first gate that can alter whether a request
// SUCCEEDS — it ships behind its own default-off flag (LXCGatingEnabled) and is
// inert until deliberately enabled.
//
// CHECK-before-serve (not debit-before-serve): a no-lock read of the LXC
// balance (the existing GetLXCBalance), decide block/allow, serve, and let the
// EXISTING post-serve shadow debit (shadowSpendLXC) book the real cost. No
// reservation, no refund primitive (refund is structurally forbidden by
// TestNoReverseConversionPath — untouched).
//
// COHERENCE — gating is INERT unless shadow is ALSO on. Gating means "block
// when unaffordable, then debit," but the only serving-path debit is
// shadowSpendLXC (gated on lxcShadowEnabled). Gating without shadow would block
// requests yet never move LXC — blocking with no accounting on a frozen
// balance. So the gate requires BOTH lxcGatingEnabled() AND lxcShadowEnabled():
// a two-flag staging (shadow=observe, shadow+gating=enforce) where a half-config
// fails safe toward serving.
//
// PRE-SERVE ESTIMATE is input-only (output unknown pre-call), so the gate
// UNDER-blocks by design — exactly like the budget gate's
// estCost = budgetEstimateUSD(model, prompt). ⚠ THAT COMPARISON USED TO BE FALSE IN
// ONE RESPECT AND IS NOW TRUE: the budget gate priced through alerts.CostUSD, which
// is exactly zero for any model the catalog does not hold, while this gate has always
// gone through the resolver. W6.19 (#487) moved it onto budgetEstimateUSD, which
// mirrors lxcEstimate — same resolver, same catalog.PurposeCharge. The true
// output-inclusive cost books post-serve via the shadow debit.
//
// FAIL-OPEN on a balance-read error: log and ALLOW (mirrors the workspace
// spend cap — "rather under-enforce than fail-closed on a transient DB error").
// A fail-open admit is still booked post-serve by the shadow debit — bounded
// slack, not a free call.

// lxcBalanceReader is the minimal read surface the gates need — no-lock balance
// reads. *economy.DualTokenStore satisfies it. Deliberately separate from
// lxcSpendSink so the shadow path stays untouched. GetUnallocatedLXC is the
// balance less what the workspace's agents hold (B19.13): what a request not
// made with an agent's key may spend.

// UP (ceil): a conservative estimate never under-reserves a sub-µLXC.
//
// ⚠ IT PRICES VIA CostUSDResolved, NOT CostUSD, for the same reason reserveEstimateLXC does — and this
// one is easier to miss, because both of its callers treat a zero as PERMISSION:
//
//	agentAllocationBlocks — the immediate-DEBIT path taken whenever p.reservationActive() is false
//	                        (proxy.go:799). `estLXC <= 0` returned false = serve, WITHOUT DEBITING.
//	                        LENS_LXC_AGENT_ALLOCATION_ENABLED defaults TRUE, so this was live.
//	lxcGateBlocks         — the balance ADMISSION gate. A zero can never exceed a balance, so an
//	                        unknown model was never gated, even on a workspace with no credit.
//
// PurposeCharge (the FLOOR) is right for both. This debit is immediate and never refunded, so
// over-charging on a rate we admit is a guess is the indefensible direction; and for the gate a floor
// starts blocking a zero-balance workspace without over-blocking a paying one.
//
// An EMPTY prompt still yields 0, correctly — zero tokens really is zero cost.
//
// ⚠ BUT IT IS NOT THE ONLY CASE, WHICH IS WHAT THIS SAID ("for that case and only that case"). The
// ceil above is applied to the µLXC conversion; the TOKEN conversion one line below is len(prompt)/4,
// which FLOORS. Every prompt of 1, 2 or 3 bytes is therefore zero tokens and zero µLXC on ANY model,
// known or unknown, and takes both callers' `<= 0` branch: agentAllocationBlocks serves it without
// debiting (measured against an exhausted sub-budget on real Postgres — see
// TestRealPG_AnExhaustedAgentCeilingStillServesASubFourBytePrompt) and lxcGateBlocks admits it on a
// workspace with no credit, since a zero can never exceed a balance. The boundary is pinned from both
// sides in lxc_estimate_short_prompt_test.go; closing it re-prices or refuses live traffic and is a
// decision rather than a repair.
//
// ⚠ AND "UNDER FOUR BYTES" IS STILL TOO SMALL A DESCRIPTION OF THE FREE PATH. The estimate is not floored
// on the bytes the CLIENT SENT, it is floored on the bytes extractPrompt CAN SEE — and extractPrompt reads
// `messages[]` only. An OpenAI EMBEDDINGS body carries `input`, so every embeddings request yields the empty
// prompt and prices at 0 no matter how large it is: 40 KB of source code, measured, on ANY model. That route
// is live (`/v1/proxy/openai/*` is a wildcard to HandleOpenAI) and a released client uses it. The empty
// prompt was already pinned by embeddings_route_test.go — but only as a CACHE fact, with the cache guard
// named as what makes it safe; nothing was ever asked about the three money seams reading the same
// extractor. Pinned from both sides in lxc_estimate_embeddings_test.go.

// by exactly the output cost), this is a true upper bound on the delivered cost, so the settle only ever
// refunds. maxOutTokens is BOUNDED by the caller (explicit max_tokens, else a sane cap — never catalog max).
//
// ⚠ IT PRICES VIA CostUSDResolved, NOT CostUSD. An unknown model used to price at 0 here, which made
// heldLXC 0, which made agentReserveBlocks return "no hold" — so the request carried no reservation, the
// settle had nothing to charge against, and the sub-budget ceiling was never consulted. A hold falls back
// to the provider's most expensive known model: over-holding is refunded by the settle, under-holding
// leaks the ceiling, so HIGH is the conservative direction here.

// ⚠ "A TRUE UPPER BOUND ON THE DELIVERED COST" IS FALSE FOR AN EMBEDDING MODEL, AND MEASURED SO
// (lxc_estimate_embeddings_test.go). The bound is input + maxOutTokens × the OUTPUT rate, and for the three
// seeded embedding models that rate is 0 — correctly, embeddings emit no output tokens. So the output term
// vanishes, the whole hold reduces to the input term, and the input term is itself 0 because extractPrompt
// reads `messages[]` while an embeddings body carries `input`. A 40 KB embeddings request therefore holds
// NOTHING on every allowance a caller can supply (1, 512, 4096, 128000 all measured), and takes
