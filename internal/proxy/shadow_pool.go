// shadow_pool.go — the WRITE-SIDE shadow log for cross-tenant cache pooling (W4.9). It records that
// a fresh, cacheable response was generated, so the pooled hit rate becomes computable from repeats
// while pooling itself stays off.
//
// ⚠ WHY IT IS ON THE WRITE SIDE, WHICH IS THE FINDING THAT SHAPED IT AND NOT AN IMPLEMENTATION
// CHOICE. The obvious shadow log does the pooled LOOKUP on a private miss and records the would-be
// hit without serving it. It CANNOT REPORT ANYTHING BUT ZERO: tryExactPooled and trySemanticPooled
// read a keyspace written only under poolGate.DecidePoolableOnWrite, and both sides route through
// the same PoolabilityGate.Participant predicate (global switch AND workspace opt-in). Off means
// the pooled keyspace is EMPTY, so the lookup misses every time, forever — and "0 would have
// pooled" is then read as evidence that pooling is worthless rather than as evidence that the
// off-switch also emptied the thing being measured.
//
// THE SAFETY IS STRUCTURAL, and it is the same argument shadow_lxc.go and pattern_capture.go make:
// shadowPoolObservation returns NOTHING. A void, post-serve, error-swallowed call cannot block,
// delay, fail or alter any request — there is no return value a serve path could branch on.
//
// CANNOT SERVE, CANNOT POOL, CANNOT SPEND. The sink surface is one persist-only method. It has no
// cache client, so it cannot read or write the pooled keyspace; no ledger handle, so it cannot
// mint; and it is handed FINGERPRINTS, not prompt text or response bytes, so the table it writes
// cannot become a prompt log. Turning this observation into a serve would mean writing new code,
// not flipping a flag.
//
// Inert by default: gated on PoolShadowLogEnabled (default false) AND a wired sink.

// poolShadowSink is the minimal surface the proxy depends on — one method, persist-only.
// *poolshadow.Recorder satisfies it. It deliberately exposes NO read-back and no lookup: the rate
// is computed offline by an operator, never by the serve path.

//
// ⚠ THE CALLER GATES ON THE SAME shouldCache IT GATES storeCaches ON. That is deliberate: a
// response the product would not cache could never have been in the pool either, so logging it
// would put rows in the denominator that no amount of pooling could ever have converted — a rate
// deflated by construction. PII-flagged and quality-rejected responses are excluded for exactly
// that reason, not only for privacy.

// rows from live ones without knowing how the flag was set that day.
