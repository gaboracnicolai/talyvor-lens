// stream_unpriced_cost_test.go — the streamed settle and the buffered settle
// pricing the same request differently, and what that costs the budget.
//
// ⚠ THE CLAIM UNDER TEST IS THE CODE'S OWN. recordStreamSpend says of its cost
// basis: "Mirrors the buffered path exactly." The buffered path prices through
// alerts.CostUSDResolved on BOTH branches, and says why in as many words —
// "Priced through the resolver so an unknown model still cannot come out at
// zero" (proxy.go, the costEstimated block). The streamed path used
// alerts.CostUSDDetailed / alerts.CostUSD, and those return EXACTLY ZERO for a
// model the catalog does not price.
//
// ⚠ AND THE POLICY FOR AN UNPRICED MODEL IS ALREADY WRITTEN DOWN, in
// alerts.WarnUnpricedModel's own message: a charge falls back "to its cheapest (a
// floor, never an over-bill)" and "until then this workspace is under-billed".
// So zero was never the intended answer; the resolver's floor was. Aligning the
// streamed path is implementing that, not choosing it.
//
// The catalog holds 45 models. `gpt-4`, `gpt-4-turbo` and `claude-3-opus` are not
// among them — measured, not assumed, by the first test below, which refuses to
// run if the model it uses has since been priced.

// unpricedProbeModel is a model this test needs to be ABSENT from the catalog.
// Using a real, expensive, widely-used name rather than an invented one, because
// the finding is that real names are missing.
const unpricedProbeModel = "gpt-4"

// pricedProbeModel is present, and is the control: whatever is asserted about an
// unpriced model must NOT hold for a priced one, or the test is measuring the
// plumbing rather than the pricing.
