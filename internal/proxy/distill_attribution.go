// distill_attribution.go — the S1 distill attribution WRITE: a durable,
// MINT-FREE record of a CONSENTED cross-tenant pooled-distill serve (who
// contributed the artifact, who was served, the content hash).
//
// THE SAFETY IS STRUCTURAL (same shape as capturePattern / the pooled mint):
// recordDistillServes returns NOTHING — a void, post-serve, error-swallowed,
// detached call cannot block, delay, fail, or alter any request. The sink
// interface exposes ONLY RecordDistillServe — there is no credit/earn method, so
// this path cannot mint by construction.
//
// GATED on ALL of: (1) the three-switch distill-pooling consent already
// authorized the cross-tenant serve (the fact is emitted ONLY on the consented
// branch of tryConvertBlock), (2) owner != requester (self-serve skipped
// upstream), and (3) the requester's logging policy is not None (the row records
// a content hash). Default-off: a nil sink ⇒ no call at all.

// distillServeFact is a consented cross-tenant distill serve surfaced up from
// MaybeDistill so serve() can record it post-flush. owner is the artifact's
// contributing workspace; the requester is the serving request's workspace.
