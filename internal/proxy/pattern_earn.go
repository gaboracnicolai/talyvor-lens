// pattern_earn.go — the Phase-3 routing-pattern EARNING wire-up (S4): the FIRST
// pattern-earning stage that touches the serve path. It routes an opted-in,
// authenticated workspace's served request into RecordPattern (which credits
// LENS via the S1/S2/S3-hardened earn path) INSTEAD of the mint-free capture
// write — earn and capture are mutually exclusive (earnPattern returns whether
// it took the corpus row; the caller runs capture only when it didn't).
//
// SERVE-NEUTRAL WHEN OFF: the flag check is the FIRST guard, before any auth
// read / IsOptedIn DB read / hash. Flag-off ⇒ earnPattern returns false at that
// guard with zero work, and the caller's capturePattern runs exactly as today.
//
// SAME ERROR BELT as capturePattern: detached context.WithoutCancel, void
// effect on serving, logged-and-swallowed write error. Called POST-FLUSH at the
// same seam as capturePattern — the IsOptedIn read and the credit run on the
// serve goroutine AFTER the client response is flushed, on a detached context,
// so nothing the client awaits is held on them.
//
// The earn sink is DELIBERATELY SEPARATE from the capture sink: the capture
// sink stays one mint-free method (cannot mint by construction); this is the
// mint-capable surface, gated by LENS_PATTERN_EARNING_ENABLED.

// patternEarnSink is the earn surface the proxy depends on: the opt-in read
// (sourced at the seam, AND'd into the gate) + the crediting earn write.
// *mining.PatternMiner satisfies both.
