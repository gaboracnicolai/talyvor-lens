// B17.29 — AN ANSWER PAID FOR ONCE IS NOT PAID FOR AGAIN.
//
// A workspace served another's answer from the shared pool pays the pooled price for it. Asked the
// same thing again — in a new chat, or by a client retry — it is served that answer again, and it is
// its earlier answer: 0 LXC, and no second royalty. No copy of the answer is kept for the workspace
// (the contributor's deletion and a thumbs-down must still stop it being served); only a marker that
// it was paid for, naming the pooled entry and the answer's digest, so a changed answer is charged.

// pooledPaidBefore reports whether wsID has already been charged for exactly this pooled answer.
