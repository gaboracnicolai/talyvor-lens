// ⚠ THE FIFTH FREE PATH — AND IT IS NOT MEASURED IN PROMPT BYTES.
//
// lxc_estimate_short_prompt_test.go pinned the FOURTH: `len(prompt)/4` floors, so a 1–3 byte prompt
// is zero tokens and takes both callers' `<= 0` free branch. That file's own framing is "shorter than
// four bytes", and it left one question open in the queue, verbatim:
//
//	"AND THE HOLD PATH WAS NOT MEASURED HERE — SOMEBODY SHOULD. reserveEstimateLXC shares the same
//	 len(prompt)/4 floor but adds maxOutTokens, so heldLXC is probably > 0 for a short prompt whenever
//	 the caller-bounded output allowance is non-zero; agentReserveBlocks' own `heldLXC <= 0 → no hold`
//	 branch is therefore reachable only if maxOut can be 0, which I did NOT verify through the wire."
//
// ⚠ THIS FILE ANSWERS IT, AND THE ANSWER IS NOT THE ONE THE QUESTION EXPECTED. `maxOut` can NOT be 0:
// boundedMaxOut returns the explicit max_tokens, else the configured cap, else a hardcoded 4096, and
// every one of those branches is > 0 (pinned below). The `heldLXC <= 0` branch is reachable anyway,
// through TWO doors neither the fourth free path nor its question looked at:
//
//	DOOR 1 — THE ESTIMATOR IS BLIND, NOT LENIENT. extractPrompt reads `messages[]`. An OpenAI
//	         EMBEDDINGS body carries `input`. Every embeddings request therefore yields the EMPTY
//	         prompt — at 12 bytes and at 40 KB alike — so the free path is not "under four bytes",
//	         it is AN ENTIRE ENDPOINT, at any size. /v1/proxy/openai/* is a wildcard route onto
//	         HandleOpenAI (registered in cmd/lens/main.go — no line cited, it would decay), and
//	         embeddings_route_test.go proves that route really forwards and is really served.
//
//	DOOR 2 — THE HOLD'S OUTPUT ALLOWANCE PRICES AT ZERO. The conservative hold exists precisely to
//	         close the input-only leak by adding maxOut × the output rate. For the three SEEDED
//	         embedding models that rate is 0 — correctly, embeddings emit no output tokens — so the
//	         term that was supposed to make the hold a true upper bound contributes exactly nothing,
//	         and the hold collapses onto the same blind zero.
//
// The two zeros are INDEPENDENT and they stack: door 1 alone frees the two input-only seams
// (agentAllocationBlocks, lxcGateBlocks) on ANY model; door 2 is what additionally frees the HOLD,
// which is the seam documented as the airtight one.
//
// ⚠ THE EMPTY PROMPT WAS ALREADY KNOWN — TO THE CACHE, AND ONLY TO THE CACHE.
// embeddings_route_test.go's third test pins the very same fact and says of it: "EVERY EXTRACTOR
// STILL SEES AN EMPTY PROMPT — that is not fixed here, and THE CACHE GUARD is what makes it safe."
// The cache guard does make the CACHE safe. Nothing was ever asked about the three money seams that
// read the same extractor's output, and that is the whole defect: a fact was measured, pinned, and
// its blast radius scoped to one consumer.
//
// ⚠ NOT FIXED, DELIBERATELY, AND FOR A REASON THAT IS WRITTEN DOWN NEXT DOOR. Teaching extractPrompt
// to read `input` is the obvious repair and it is FORBIDDEN here: embeddings_route_test.go states
// that if extractPrompt ever derives a prompt from an embeddings body, "the CROSS-TENANT POOLING
// question must be decided first: these are source-code embeddings". Pricing embeddings at the money
// seams instead would start REFUSING requests that are served today, on a ceiling nobody set with
// embeddings in mind. Both are product decisions. This file pins the measured boundary from both
// sides so the path cannot widen silently and whoever decides has to edit a test that says what they
// are changing.

// embeddingsModels are the seeded models whose OUTPUT rate is legitimately zero — door 2.
