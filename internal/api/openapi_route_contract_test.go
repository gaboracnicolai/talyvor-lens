// openapi_route_contract_test.go — the served OpenAPI document against the routes the binary
// actually registers.
//
// openapi.go is not a README. It is SERVED at GET /openapi.json, which means a client generates
// against it. W6.15 (#483) compared one route's RESPONSE BODY with components.schemas.LocalEndpoint
// and found it shipping four undeclared fields. That was one route and one schema; nobody had
// compared the PATH LIST.
//
// ⚠ THE TWO DIRECTIONS ARE NOT THE SAME KIND OF FACT, and this file treats them differently.
//
//	PUBLISHED BUT NOT REGISTERED   unambiguous. A client reads the contract, calls it, gets 404.
//	                               Measured at ZERO today, and guarded so it stays there.
//	REGISTERED BUT NOT PUBLISHED   a judgement. 122 non-admin /v1 routes are outside the document
//	                               and openapi.go's own header says why: "Lens has too many routes
//	                               to spec every single one". Counted and classified, NOT called a
//	                               defect — reporting it as one would be manufacturing a finding.
//
// ⚠ AND A FALSE FINDING GOT THIS FAR BEFORE BEING CAUGHT. The first run reported
// `POST /v1/proxy/openai/{path}` and `/v1/proxy/anthropic/{path}` as published-but-unregistered.
// They are registered — as `/v1/proxy/openai/*`. chi spells a wildcard `*`; OpenAPI spells it
// `{path}`. Two confident, serious-sounding, entirely false findings from a spelling difference,
// and it is the flattering direction. normalisePath below is what makes the comparison honest, and
// TestNormalisationCollapsesChiWildcardsAndOpenAPIParams is what keeps it that way.

// registration matches a chi route registration in main.go. The `With(...)` clause is optional and
// carries middleware, not path.
//
// ⚠ THE LEADING `/` IN THE PATH GROUP IS LOAD-BEARING. Without it this matches `q.Get("model")` —
// url.Values.Get, not a route — and the scoping count for W6.29 was inflated by 13 before that was
// noticed. A route census that counts query-parameter reads as routes overstates coverage.
