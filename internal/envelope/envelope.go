// Package envelope is Lens's envelope encryption for provider secrets — the customer-supplied
// upstream credentials BYOK needs Lens to take custody of (W6.10).
//
// WHY ENVELOPE AND NOT A SINGLE STATIC KEY, MEASURED RATHER THAN PREFERRED. W6.10 says to read how
// talyvor-track does it and mirror it "unless there is a measured reason not to". Track's
// internal/integrations/crypto.go is a SINGLE static AES-256-GCM key supplied whole via
// TRACK_INTEGRATION_ENCRYPTION_KEY. Measured in talyvor-track at 2026-08-26: its integrations
// package contains ZERO rotation code (`git grep -licE 'rotat' -- internal/integrations` = 0
// production files, positive control `encrypt` = 4 files). That is the measured reason: under a
// single key, rotating means re-encrypting every stored secret, so in practice nobody rotates. A
// credential store that cannot rotate its own key is the same product gap W1.9.1 exists for, one
// layer down. Envelope splits it: each secret gets its own random data key (DEK), the DEK is
// wrapped by the operator's key-encryption key (KEK), and rotation rewraps DEKs while the
// ciphertext of the secret itself is never touched (see Rewrap, and TestP5).
//
// WHAT IS MIRRORED FROM TRACK, VERBATIM, BECAUSE IT IS THE BETTER HALF OF THE POINTER: the posture.
// Unset ⇒ the capability is disabled and there is NO plaintext fallback (Lens still boots). Set ⇒
// validated to exactly 32 decoded bytes AT BOOT, so a wrong length is fail-loud at startup rather
// than a broken-crypto surprise at first use. See internal/config.
//
// WRITE-ONLY, ALWAYS. Nothing in this package hands a plaintext back to its caller. The only way to
// see a secret is Use, which lends it to a callback and wipes the buffer before returning — so a
// caller cannot keep it by accident, and no handler can return one. TestP6 enforces that over the
// package's exported surface, so a future edit that adds a getter goes red rather than unnoticed.
//
// WHAT HAPPENS IF THE KEK IS LOST: every secret wrapped under it is unrecoverable. There is no
// escrow, no recovery code and no Talyvor-side copy — that is the property that lets Talyvor say a
// compromise of the database alone does not hand over customer provider accounts. The operator-
// visible symptom is deliberately specific: Use returns ErrUnknownKey NAMING the key id it needed
// (TestP8), so "you dropped a KEK rows still reference" never looks like data corruption. Recovery
// is re-entry of the provider credential by the customer, not decryption. docs/provider-secret-envelope.md
// carries the operator runbook.
