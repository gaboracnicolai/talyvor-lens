// statement.go — B32.42: EVERY WEEKLY PAYOUT HAS A STATEMENT OF ITS WEEK.
//
// A seller's statement for a week (an ISO week, UTC, such as 2026-W41) is read from the marketplace journal: what
// moved through their available balance that week, and where it came from. It opens with what was brought forward
// from earlier weeks; adds the sales released to them from the holdback that week, less Talyvor's fee and the
// royalties those sales paid to the originals they remix, and the royalties and split shares released to them from
// others' sales; takes off refunds and chargebacks, earnings taken as credits and what is carried forward to the next
// week; and ends with Stripe's fees. Its lines sum to the net its payout paid — 0 in a week without one, when it is
// all carried forward. The VAT Talyvor collected from the buyers of those sales is shown for information only: it
// was never the seller's, and is not a line.
//
// To a seller who agreed to self-billing, the week's payout is also a self-billed invoice from them to Talyvor (B32.43,
// selfbill.go): the statement carries it, and the VAT the seller charged on it is a line, paid with the payout.

// The lines of a statement, in order.
