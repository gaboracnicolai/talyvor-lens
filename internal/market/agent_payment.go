// agent_payment.go — B19.15: AN AGENT PAYS ANOTHER COMPANY'S AGENT, THROUGH THE MARKETPLACE.
//
// Payments among one company's agents stay inside its closed loop (economy.PayAgent). A payment to another
// company's agent leaves it, so it goes through the marketplace like a use of a listing: one billed
// market_uses row (no listing; payee_agent_id names the agent paid), metered onto the paying company's
// monthly bill by MeterPending, cleared when that bill is paid, earned by the payee's company, payable after
// the 14-day holdback and paid out through B20.5 — and reversed if the bill is refunded or charged back. The
// paying agent's rules judge it first (economy), and the single-party detector refuses a wash trade.

// CompanyPayeeRefusal says why payerWorkspaceID may not pay an agent of payeeWorkspaceID — the two share a
// card or an owner, so it would be a company paying itself — or "" when it may.
