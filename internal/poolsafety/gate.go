// Gate holds the live cross-tenant pooling decision: whether the embedding configuration this
// process is running IS the one that last passed `lens poolcheck`.
//
// ⚠ WHY THIS IS RE-READ RATHER THAN DECIDED ONCE AT BOOT.
//
// The attestation lives in the database; the configuration it attests to lives in the process
// environment. Those have different lifetimes, and reading both once at boot creates a
// sequencing trap that silently disables pooling forever:
//
//	deploy:  docker compose up -d     → gateway boots, finds NO attestation → pooling off
//	deploy:  lens poolcheck           → passes, records the attestation
//	         ...nothing restarts the gateway, so it is still holding "off"
//
// That is not hypothetical — it is the order the full-stack runbook prescribes, because
// poolcheck needs a running container to exec into. A boot-only read means the very first
// deployment can never turn pooling on, and the failure is silent and looks like the feature
// simply not working.
//
// The alternative fix is a runbook step that restarts the gateway after poolcheck. That works
// on the scripted path and only there: it does nothing for an operator who runs poolcheck out
// of band later, and it puts a subtlety they cannot see into a document they may not follow.
// Re-reading makes the system self-correcting instead — run poolcheck whenever, and pooling
// follows within one refresh interval.
//
// What re-reading does NOT do, deliberately: the model and threshold are read from the process
// environment at boot and cannot change without a restart, so this only ever re-evaluates the
// DATABASE side of the comparison. That asymmetry is the correct one — config is boot-scoped,
// a shared mutable row is not.
