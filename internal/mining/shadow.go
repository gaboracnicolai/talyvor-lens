// shadow.go — shadow mode for mints that have not been validated.
//
// A shadow mint COMPUTES what it would pay, RECORDS that number, and CREDITS NOTHING. No balance
// changes, no spendable token appears, supply does not move. It exists so six unproven mints can
// run during a trial and be MEASURED, with testers told plainly they are not being paid for them.
//
// WHERE IT INTERCEPTS, AND WHY THERE. Every LENS mint funnels through exactly two kernels —
// applyTx (spendable) and heldInner (held) — which is the same property the U6 Sybil floor relies
// on: a new mint track cannot skip a check placed there. Shadow mode sits at those same two
// points, immediately after verifyEarn, so:
//
//   - a mint added next year is shadowable without touching its call site, and
//   - the interception happens BEFORE any ledger INSERT, so no row is written and then undone.
//
// ⚠ IT SITS AFTER verifyEarn ON PURPOSE, and this bounds what the data means: a workspace that
// is not verified-to-earn is rejected by the U6 floor before shadow mode is reached, so it
// produces NO shadow rows. The recorded numbers are therefore "what would have been paid to
// workspaces that could legitimately earn", not "what the mint would compute for anyone".
//
// ── HOW A SHADOW ROW IS STRUCTURALLY INCAPABLE OF BECOMING REAL ─────────────
//
// Not a flag. Four independent obstacles, three of them compile-time or schema-level:
//
//  1. THE SINK CANNOT JOIN THE MINT TRANSACTION. ShadowSink.RecordShadow takes NO pgx.Tx and is
//     handed no LedgerStore, so it cannot write inside the tx that is about to roll back, and
//     TestShadowSink_CannotReachTheLedger reads the source to fail if the interface is widened.
//     ⚠ THIS ITEM CLAIMED "widening that interface is the only way in" AND THAT WAS FALSE. The
//     concrete sink is shadowmint.Recorder, constructed as shadowmint.New(pool) in
//     cmd/lens/main.go: it holds a *pgxpool.Pool for the same database, which is strictly more
//     than a pgx.Tx. This obstacle bans the narrow door; the wide one was already open, and a
//     schema-valid ledger INSERT added to RecordShadow passed the whole suite (106 packages, real
//     Postgres, -race). What closes it is a guard in the WRITER's package — see obstacle 2.
//  2. A DIFFERENT TABLE. Shadow rows go to lens_shadow_mints. Every balance, ledger sum and
//     supply figure in this repository queries lens_token_ledger, so none of them can see a
//     shadow row. That converts an N-reader obligation ("remember to exclude shadow rows") into
//     a ONE-WRITER obligation ("never write one into the ledger").
//     ⚠ AND THE OBLIGATION WAS PINNED ON THE NON-WRITER. TestShadowMint_NeverTouchesTheTokenLedger
//     reads THIS file — which runs no SQL at all — so it could never have failed for the reason it
//     names. The writer is internal/shadowmint, and it now carries the matching guard,
//     TestShadowRecorderNamesOnlyItsOwnTable, which reads its SQL string literals (not its text:
//     recorder.go legitimately discusses the ledger in prose). Both are kept: this one stops the
//     interception logic growing a ledger write, that one stops the recorder doing it.
//  3. NO CREDIT PATH READS IT. There is no settle, finalize, or promote step from
//     lens_shadow_mints into the ledger. Making a shadow row real requires WRITING NEW CODE that
//     inserts into the ledger from this table — a reviewable change, not a config flip.
//  4. FAIL-CLOSED ON RECORD FAILURE. If the observation cannot be written, the mint is still
//     refused. Falling through to a real credit would pay for an unproven mint at exactly the
//     moment we lost the ability to see it.

// from a shadow row becoming real, and that is precisely what this design exists to prevent.
