// counted_mint_gating_test.go — EVERY LENS THAT ENTERS SUPPLY MUST HAVE BEEN
// GATED SOMEWHERE.
//
// mint_gate.go's header claims the verified-to-earn gate "covers all mint paths
// at once and a new mint track CANNOT skip it". That claim is about a set
// (mintTypeList) and it is checkable against a DIFFERENT set that answers the
// other half of the question: countedSupplyTypeList, the types GetTotalSupply
// counts as minted LENS. Between them the invariant is:
//
//	If supply counts a type as newly minted LENS, then the moment that LENS
//	first accrued to the earner ran through the U6 floor and the U6 rate cap.
//
// The two lists are DELIBERATELY unequal (see both their docs) — supply counts
// at SETTLEMENT, the gate fires at the MINT MOMENT, which for most tracks is an
// earlier `_held` row. So the invariant cannot be "the lists match"; it needs a
// declaration of WHICH gated moment each counted type settles, and then an
// OBSERVATION that the declared moment is really gated.
//
// ⚠ WHY THIS IS OBSERVED AND NOT READ. Asking `IsMintType(x)` re-reads the very
// set whose completeness is in question, and a name rule ("x settles x_held")
// is the weak-instrument shape this repo has been bitten by before. So each
// declaration is checked by DRIVING THE REAL KERNELS with a recording verifier
// and a 1-µLENS rate cap, and reading back whether the controls actually fired.

// recordingVerifier ALLOWS every mint and records whether it was consulted.
// Allowing (rather than refusing) is deliberate: the observation is "did the
// kernel ask?", and refusing would abort the credit before the rate cap could
// be observed on the same call.
