// Package earnings answers one workspace-scoped question: what has this workspace EARNED, and how
// much of that is real yet? (W4.6.1 step 7 — the surface behind "your plan is $20, your answers
// earned $6 of it back".)
//
// ⚠ THE LEDGER IS THE SOURCE, NOT THE SIX CLAIM TABLES. Six tables carry a
// contributor_workspace_id — pool_royalty_mints, distill_royalty_mints, eval_contribution_mints,
// routing_prediction_mints, node_latency_mints, confidential_compute_mints — and every one of them
// records what a mint INTENDED. What a workspace was PAID is `lens_token_ledger`, and the two can
// disagree: config.go's ReputationBondedMintingEnabled comment records a measured case where the
// bond reduces the held CREDIT while the claim row keeps the unreduced base. A customer-facing
// figure read off the claim tables would state the larger of two numbers. One query on the ledger,
// scoped by workspace_id, cannot drift from what moved.
//
// ⚠ AND THE TYPE VOCABULARY IS FRAGMENTED ACROSS THREE PACKAGES IN TWO REPRESENTATIONS, WHICH IS
// WHY THIS FILE IS A MAP AND NOT A LIST. Measured 2026-08-26: `internal/mining` declares 35
// exported Type* constants, `internal/povi` declares one more (and `internal/mining/mint_gate.go`
// already carries a cycle-free duplicate literal of it, saying so in a comment), and
// `internal/economy` writes SEVEN ledger types as BARE STRING LITERALS with no constant at all
// (marketplace_buy, marketplace_fee, marketplace_unsold_refund, marketplace_listing,
// marketplace_refund, stake, unstake). No static census over constants can see any of them.
//
// ⚠ AND THE COUNT WAS FIVE UNTIL A DERIVED WALK CORRECTED IT, WHICH IS THE WHOLE ARGUMENT OF THIS
// FILE MADE AT MY OWN EXPENSE. The first version of this map carried five, taken from a grep for
// the type argument on the same line as the ledger call. `marketplace_listing` and
// `marketplace_refund` pass their type on the FOLLOWING line, so the grep could not see them — a
// 29% undercount in a census I had just written a paragraph about being careful with. The AST walk
// in TestE2 found both. A hand-built population is wrong in the direction nobody checks. So this package guards itself twice:
//
//   - STATICALLY, over the two packages that DO use constants (classification_census_test.go), so a
//     new mint type added the normal way must be classified or the build goes red; and
//   - AT RUNTIME, via the Unclassified bucket below, which reports any type actually present in a
//     workspace's ledger that this map does not know. That is the half that covers the literals.
//
// A silent "0" is the failure mode this package exists to avoid, so nothing is dropped anywhere: a
// type this file has never heard of is REPORTED, not skipped.
