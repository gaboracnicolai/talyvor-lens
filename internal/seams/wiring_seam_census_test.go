// wiring_seam_census_test.go — exported Set*/Register*/Enable*/Attach* methods on
// internal/* types that NO PRODUCTION CODE EVER CALLS.
//
// ⚠ WHY A SEAM IS DIFFERENT FROM DEAD CODE. A `Set*` method is a socket somebody
// left for main.go to plug into. An unplugged socket is a feature that exists,
// compiles, is tested, and does nothing — and unlike dead code it READS AS FINISHED.
// W6.17 (#485) is the evidence: BatchRouter.SetSettleHook has no production caller,
// and that single fact is why main.go passes a hardcoded `false` for settleWired and
// the whole /v1/batch lane cannot open in any configuration.
//
// 113 seams found; 103 have a production caller. The TEN that do not are recorded
// below — and the split inside those ten is the point: SIX are unwired and SAY SO in
// their own doc comments (test seams, reserved anchors, test-only threshold
// overrides), and FOUR read as finished. Recording all ten rather than filtering the
// honest ones is what makes the difference visible.
//
// ⚠ THE CENSUS LIED TWICE BEFORE IT WAS RIGHT, and both lies pointed the same
// (flattering-to-me) way — calling a LIVE seam dead:
//
//   - SAME-PACKAGE CALLERS. The first pass looked only for callers OUTSIDE the
//     declaring package and flagged localrouter.Router.SetNodePrice and
//     benchprobe.Store.SetProbeScore. Both are called from their own package's
//     production code (multi.go's price-sync loop; scheduler.go). A seam used
//     internally is wired.
//   - THE FILE NAME IS EVIDENCE. proxy.SetAnthropicURL / SetGoogleURL live in
//     bench_setters.go and carry no doc comment, so a doc-comment keyword scan
//     called them live-looking. The file says what they are.

// seamVerb is the one question here that is genuinely ABOUT A NAME — does this method read as
// wiring — so it stays a pattern. The two STRUCTURAL questions next to it (is this a declaration,
// is that a call) are answered by a parser; see
// TestSeamScannersReadDeclarationsAndCallsNotSpellings for what happened when they were not.
//
// ⚠ THE `[A-Z]` IS LOAD-BEARING: without it `Settle` is a `Set` seam. The census's own
// unwiredSeams map records SetSettleHook, so the two words meet in this package for real.

// ── the census reads DECLARATIONS AND CALLS, not spellings ───────────────────────────────────────

// ⚠ THIS CENSUS MATCHED TEXT ON BOTH HALVES, AND MEASURING IT FOUND ONE FAILURE IN EACH DIRECTION.
// Measured 2026-08-28 (tab-q6d3) against the real guard, by adding one production file per arm.
//
// ⚠⚠ SAID FIRST, BECAUSE IT DECIDES WHAT THIS CHANGE IS: THE CENSUS IS CORRECT ON TODAY'S TREE AND
// THIS FIXES NO LIVE MISCOUNT. A parser enumeration run beside the regex agrees exactly — 113 seams
// both ways, 0 seen by one and not the other; and over the 90 distinct seam method names the caller
// sweep agrees too, 0 phantom callers and 0 missed calls. Every Set*/Register*/Enable*/Attach*/Wire*
// method in internal/ today happens to name its receiver, and no comment or string happens to carry
// one of those call shapes. What was missing is that nothing would have noticed when that stopped
// being true.
//
//	DECLARATION HALF — an unwired seam the census cannot see. Each arm declares an exported Set*
//	method on an internal/ type with NO production caller, which is exactly what this guard exists
//	to report:
//	  func (p *T) SetX(...)  named receiver   -> REPORTED   (the positive control)
//	  func (*T) SetX(...)    unnamed pointer  -> NOT REPORTED
//	  func (T) SetX(...)     unnamed value    -> NOT REPORTED
//	  func (p *T[P]) SetX()  generic          -> NOT REPORTED
//	  the same line in a /* block comment */  -> REPORTED as a seam on a type that does not exist
//
//	CALLER HALF — and this one fails in the direction that HIDES what the guard is for. A doc
//	comment in a production file reading
//	    //	store.SetAutonomous(ctx, workspaceID, true)
//	flips internal/routingbrain:Store.SetAutonomous from unwired to WIRED. The socket is still
//	empty; the census now says it is plugged in. Documenting an unwired seam is exactly what one
//	does on finding one, so the failure mode is reachable by the ordinary act of writing it down.
//	⚠ AND THE ERROR MESSAGE MISDIAGNOSES IT — it offers "the sweep counts a test as production",
//	which is the wrong culprit and would send the next reader to the wrong place.
//
// So the structural questions — is this a DECLARATION, is that a CALL — are answered by a parser.
// The question that is genuinely about a NAME (does the method start with Set/Register/Enable/
// Attach/Wire) stays a pattern, because that is what it is.
