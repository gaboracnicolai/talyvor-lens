// Package modelwatch polls each provider's model list on a schedule and alerts when a provider is
// serving a model the catalog cannot price.
//
// ┌─ WHY THIS EXISTS ───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
// │ A model absent from the catalog used to be served FREE — catalog.Price returned ok=false and the │
// │ billing path spent that "not found" as the value zero: no hold, no ledger row, no ceiling check. │
// │ That hole is closed (catalog.ResolveRates has no zero outcome), but the CLOSURE IS A FLOOR, not  │
// │ a price: unknown traffic is now billed on the provider's cheapest known model, which recovers    │
// │ a fraction of the real cost. The floor buys time; it does not price anything correctly.          │
// │                                                                                                  │
// │ The only real fix is for a person to add the model with its published rate. That requires        │
// │ someone to KNOW a new model exists, and until now nobody did: the discovery mechanism was a      │
// │ customer sending traffic, i.e. after the money was already lost. This turns discovery around —   │
// │ the provider is asked what it serves, on a timer, BEFORE any request arrives.                    │
// └─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
//
// ┌─ ⚠ DETECTION ONLY. THIS PACKAGE MUST NEVER SET A PRICE. ────────────────────────────────────────┐
// │ NOT a limitation of the current implementation — a permanent rule, and here is the reason, so    │
// │ nobody has to re-derive it before deciding to "improve" this:                                    │
// │                                                                                                  │
// │ NO PROVIDER RETURNS PRICES IN ANY API. Not in /v1/models, not anywhere. Anthropic's and OpenAI's │
// │ rates exist only on human-facing marketing/docs pages, as HTML, restructured at will and changed │
// │ without notice, versioning, or changelog. Anything that scrapes them is a parser aimed at a      │
// │ moving target — and the day the markup shifts it does not fail loudly, it silently extracts the  │
// │ wrong number and bills real customers on it. A scraper on a money path is a defect that has not  │
// │ happened yet.                                                                                    │
// │                                                                                                  │
// │ So the split is deliberate and asymmetric: EXISTENCE is machine-checkable and is checked here;   │
// │ PRICE is human-verified, cited to a URL, and pinned by internal/catalog/published_rates_test.go. │
// │ Detection is cheap and safe to be wrong about (a spurious alert costs someone a minute). Pricing │
// │ is expensive to be wrong about in both directions. Never merge the two.                          │
// └─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
//
// ┌─ ⚠ WHAT THIS CANNOT CATCH — READ BEFORE TRUSTING IT ────────────────────────────────────────────┐
// │ 1. A PRICE CHANGE ON A MODEL THAT ALREADY EXISTS. This is the big one. Same id, new rate: the    │
// │    poller sees the id, finds it in the catalog, and reports nothing. Lens keeps charging the old  │
// │    rate indefinitely, and no test, metric, log or alert anywhere in this repo notices.            │
// │                                                                                                  │
// │    ⚠ THAT IS NOT THEORETICAL. On 2026-07-26 a by-hand read of the two pricing pages found FIVE   │
// │    live mispricings on existing ids: claude-opus-4-5 and claude-opus-4-6 billed at 15/75 when    │
// │    published at 5/25 (3x OVER), claude-haiku-4-5 at Haiku 3.5's 0.80/4.00 (UNDER), gpt-5.4 at    │
// │    5.00/20.00 vs 2.50/15.00 (OVER), gpt-5.4-mini at 0.50/2.00 vs 0.75/4.50 (UNDER). One of them  │
// │    had a passing test asserting the wrong number. This failure mode is the norm, not the edge.   │
// │                                                                                                  │
// │    What would actually catch it, in increasing order of reliability:                              │
// │      a) A DATED PERIODIC HUMAN RE-READ of the two pricing pages. Unglamorous and it is the        │
// │         honest answer. published_rates_test.go turns that re-read into a diff rather than a       │
// │         judgement call: change the constant, the test tells you what moved. Monthly, in the       │
// │         runbook, with the date recorded — an undated "we check sometimes" is not a control.       │
// │      b) INVOICE RECONCILIATION — the only fully automatic option, and the strongest, because the  │
// │         provider's bill is the authority that the marketing page merely describes. Sum token_     │
// │         events COGS per model per month and compare to the actual invoice; a per-model divergence │
// │         beyond rounding IS a rate change (or a tokenizer change, or a tier change — all of which  │
// │         matter and none of which this poller sees). It needs invoice ingestion, which does not    │
// │         exist yet. It is the right long-term answer and it should be built.                       │
// │      c) A provider-published price API. None exists. Do not wait for one.                         │
// │                                                                                                  │
// │ 2. A RETIRED model. A id vanishing from the list is not reported as drift here — it is not a      │
// │    money leak (requests to it fail outright, loudly, at the provider) and treating removals as    │
// │    alerts would fire on every transient list hiccup. It is still worth a periodic look.           │
// │ 3. ORG-SCOPED availability. /v1/models reflects THIS key's entitlements. A model another tenant    │
// │    can call may be invisible here; a limited-availability model may never appear at all (which is  │
// │    why claude-mythos-5 is deliberately unseeded — see verified_models_test.go).                    │
// │ 4. TIER / REGION / MODE pricing. Batch, priority, region, and Anthropic's fast mode (speed:"fast" │
// │    is a MODE on an existing id, priced ~2x, and Lens does not model it at all) all change the bill │
// │    without changing any id.                                                                       │
// │ 5. TOKENIZER CHANGES. Claude 4.7+ emit ~30% more tokens for the same text. Same id, same posted    │
// │    rate, a third more money. Only (b) sees this.                                                  │
