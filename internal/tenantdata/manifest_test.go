// manifest_test.go — THE GUARD. The manifest is a list; this is what keeps it true.
//
// It reads the LIVE SCHEMA rather than a hardcoded table list, deliberately: every hardcoded count
// in this codebase has gone stale, usually within a day, and a stale deletion manifest is worse
// than none — it produces a confident claim that someone's data is gone when a table was missed.
// So the source of truth is information_schema, and this test fails when the schema grows a
// tenant-scoped table nobody classified.
//
// COST TO RUN: it needs a database with the migrations applied, so it is an INTEGRATION test, not
// a unit test. CI already provides one (LENS_TEST_DATABASE_URL, the pgvector service in ci.yaml),
// and it applies the real embedded migration chain into a private schema — the same harness the
// register-workspace and provision tests use. Without the variable it SKIPS, which means a
// developer running `go test ./...` on a laptop with no database does not get this coverage. That
// is a real limitation and the reason it must stay in CI's required set rather than being treated
// as an optional extra.
