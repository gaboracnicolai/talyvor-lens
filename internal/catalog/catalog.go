// Package catalog is the single source of truth for the models Lens knows
// about — their provider, pricing (USD per 1M tokens), capabilities
// (vision/audio/document), and context limits. Before this, those facts were
// scattered across the alerts price table, the modality capability registry,
// and the router; consolidating them here means adding a model is data, not
// code edits in several places.
//
// Boundary: the catalog owns model FACTS (price, capabilities, context). It
// does NOT own routing POLICY — the router's cost-tier ranks, the cheap/mid/
// premium tiers, fallback chains, and provider dispatch remain in their
// packages and operate on catalog models. (modelRanks is a tier order, not a
// price order, so it isn't derivable from catalog pricing.)
//
// The registry is read-mostly and concurrency-safe: pricing/capability
// lookups happen on the request hot path, so reads take an RWMutex read lock
// and never allocate beyond the returned value. Runtime overrides (config/DB)
// layer on top of the embedded default so an operator can add or reprice a
// model without a rebuild.

// AND put REPLACES THE WHOLE ENTRY. cmd/lens advertises this variable as the way to "reprice models
// without a rebuild"; a reprice states a price and nothing else, so every FACT the catalog holds
// about that model — provider, capabilities, context window, aliases, display name — decoded as its
// zero value and overwrote the seeded truth. MEASURED through the proxy's real entry point, not
// inferred: `[{"id":"gpt-4o","input_per_1m":3.75,"output_per_1m":15.00}]` turned a 200 streaming
// vision request to gpt-4o into a 422 "model gpt-4o does not support it", dropped gpt-4o out of
// ByProvider("openai") (19 models → 18, so it stops anchoring that provider's fallback bound and
// stops being a redirect target), and emptied its capability entry in the introspection API. A price
// change silently withdrew a capability.
//
// So an override for an id the registry ALREADY holds is decoded ON TOP OF that entry: an absent
// field means "unchanged", a present one means what it says. `"capabilities":{"vision":false}` still
// turns vision off — the operator can still state a fact, they simply can no longer erase one by
// omission. An id the registry does not hold decodes from the zero Model exactly as before, because
// there is no truth to preserve and inventing one would be worse.
//
// ⚠ THE FOUR PRICE FIELDS ARE DELIBERATELY NOT PRESERVED, so this change moves NO money. They are
// zeroed before the decode, which leaves an omitted price reading exactly as it does today: unpriced,
// which ResolveRates routes to the loud fallback arm (see resolve.go#unpriced) rather than to a
// silent zero. Carrying the OLD rates forward would look tidier and would be a pricing decision —
// a model repriced 2.50 → 3.75 with cached_input_per_1m omitted would keep billing cache reads at
// the 1.25 that was 50% of the OLD list price and is 33% of the new one. That is a real question
// and it is not this function's to answer.
//
// ⚠ Lookup is by EXACT id, never through resolve(): an override written against a dated-snapshot
// ALIAS registers a new entry keyed by that alias, exactly as it does today. Merging an alias onto
// its canonical entry would rewrite the alias index as a side effect of a reprice, which is the
// class of silent consequence this function exists to remove.
//
// ⚠⚠ AN ELEMENT THAT NAMES NO MODEL IS REFUSED, AND WITH IT THE WHOLE DOCUMENT. `id` is the only
// field that says WHICH model the element is about, and an absent one used to decode to "" and be
// handed to put, which keys byID by exactly that string. Two things then happened and neither was
// said out loud: the reprice the operator wrote did NOT happen (cmd/lens still logged "applied model
// overrides count=1"), and a PHANTOM entry entered the catalog under the empty id — which the money
// path reads. MEASURED at 3fa1196 through the real functions, on 1M input + 1M output: proxy
// extractPrompt returns req.Model with no non-empty check and HandleOpenAI serves a body carrying no
// `model` key with 200, so ResolveRates("") is a live call; it billed charge $0.02 / hold $210.00 as
// `fallback` with an ERROR and a metric on every request, and with the phantom registered it billed
// $18.75 on BOTH arms as `exact` — silently, and invisibly to modelwatch, which skips exact. An
// over-bill on the charge, a collapsed ceiling on the hold, and the loud instrument switched off, all
// from writing `model` where the document wants `id`.
//
// ⚠ THE WHOLE DOCUMENT, NOT JUST THE ELEMENT, is a choice: cmd/lens#applyCatalogOverrides already
// applies NOTHING when the document does not parse, so "Lens could not read this" keeps one meaning
// and one outcome. It costs nothing on the money axis — every model the document meant to price falls
// to the fallback arm, which is non-zero by construction, defensible, and screams once per request.
// Loud-and-unpriced beats silent-and-wrong. The alternative (apply the named elements, skip the rest)
// keeps more pricing and leaves a half-applied document; it is a defensible answer and it is not the
