// seedModels is the embedded default catalog. PRICING IS MIGRATED
// BYTE-FOR-BYTE from the previous sources — alerts.modelPrices for the rates
// and modality.capabilities for the vision/audio/document flags. Do not
// "tidy" a number here: the price-parity test (golden_test.go) asserts every
// existing model still prices identically, because a silent price drift
// corrupts every budget/forecast/anomaly/ROI figure (the cost moat).
//
// ContextTokens/MaxOutput are best-effort informational values (nothing gates
// on them yet); pricing + capabilities are authoritative.

// B18.12 — ReleaseDate is the day the provider made the model generally available in its API, from
// its own release notes (fetched 2026-09-29): developers.openai.com/api/docs/changelog,
// platform.claude.com/docs/en/release-notes/overview, ai.google.dev/gemini-api/docs/changelog, the
// Bedrock model cards, docs.mistral.ai's model pages (for a -latest alias, the version it points to
// now), and for Groq's open models the day Meta, Mistral or Google released them. A dated snapshot id
// is NOT a release date (claude-haiku-4-5-20251001 launched 2025-10-15). chat-latest is an alias the
// changelog never names a model for; its date is the day its current snapshot was set. Tier is the
// model's place in its provider's line-up: frontier (the most capable), balanced, fast, embedding.

//     is therefore slightly under-priced — the safe direction for a savings claim.)
//   - openai (developers.openai.com prompt-caching): cache READ ~0.5x input for
//     the GPT-4o generation. (GPT-4.1-gen is actually 0.25x, so 0.5x UNDER-states
//     the discount — deliberately conservative so we never over-claim savings.)
