// verifiedAnthropicModels is the pinned allow-list of Anthropic model IDs Lens is permitted to seed
// into the COST-ROUTING catalog.
//
// SOURCE: GET https://api.anthropic.com/v1/models, captured live on 2026-07-19 during the first
// production standup. The API returns some models undated (claude-opus-4-6, claude-sonnet-4-6,
// claude-opus-4-8, …) and some as dated snapshots (claude-haiku-4-5-20251001, …). Where the catalog
// and router use the undated alias of a dated snapshot, BOTH forms are listed below.
//
// INVARIANT: every catalog entry that is dispatched to Anthropic — Provider=="anthropic" directly, or
// Provider=="bedrock" whose id embeds an `anthropic.claude-<family>` model — MUST name a base model in
// this set.
//
// CATCHES: a phantom entry such as "claude-haiku-4-6" (there is NO Haiku 4.6 at any version). A
// catalog entry naming a nonexistent model is invisible until a live request is cost-routed to it and
// Anthropic returns 404 not_found_error — exactly the bug the first standup hit (a claude-sonnet-4-6
// request was downgraded to the phantom "cheapest" and 404'd).
//
// INVALIDATED BY: Anthropic releasing a new model (add it here, with a price taken from a citable
// source — never a guess, a wrong rate corrupts the cost/budget/forecast tables) or retiring one
// (remove it here AND from seed.go). This is a deliberately HUMAN-maintained mirror of /v1/models: a
// live network check in CI would be flaky and couple the build to an external API.

	//   1. It is PUBLISHED on https://platform.claude.com/docs/en/about-claude/pricing with rates.
	//   2. Stronger — it is BEING SERVED THROUGH THIS PROXY TODAY. The unpriced-model hole this
	//      PR closes was found on live Opus 5 traffic, so its existence is not in question: requests
	//      on it succeeded and Talyvor paid the provider for them.
	// No API key was available in this environment to re-run GET /v1/models, so the capture itself was
	// NOT refreshed. If you have a key, re-capture and fold this entry into the list above.

	// traffic I can point to. This guard is an EXISTENCE check, and widening it from a marketing page is
	// precisely the failure it was built to catch (there is no Haiku 4.6 either, and that phantom
	// 404'd a live request). If Mythos 5 is dispatchable, the fallback prices it and the detection job
	// added in this PR alerts on it — that is the safe order: alert first, then price.

	// B15.4 — NOT from a /v1/models capture either (still no key here). Evidence: both are the CURRENT
	// lineup on https://platform.claude.com/docs/en/about-claude/models/overview (fetched 2026-09-26),
	// listed with these exact "Claude API ID"s, NOT marked limited availability, and priced on the
	// pricing page. That is the difference from claude-mythos-5 below, which stays out.
