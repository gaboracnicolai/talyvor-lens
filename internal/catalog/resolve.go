// UNPRICED MUST BE UNREPRESENTABLE ON THE MONEY PATH.
//
// Price and PriceDetailed return ok=false for an unknown model, and their doc comments say callers
// "price an unknown model at 0". Eleven callers handled that correctly because a zero is harmless in
// telemetry. The billing path did not, and the result was that a model the provider serves and this
// catalog does not know was served FREE: no hold, no spend row, no ledger trace, and Talyvor holding
// the provider bill.
//
// The lesson is not "check ok more carefully". It is that a signature which can hand back a spendable
// zero will eventually be spent. So the money path does not use those functions at all — it uses
// ResolveRates, which HAS NO ZERO OUTCOME. There is nothing to mishandle: every return is chargeable,
// and the Provenance says whether it was measured or guessed.
//
// ⚠ THAT PARAGRAPH WAS WRITTEN AS A DESCRIPTION AND WAS ONLY EVER TRUE OF ONE ARM. The fallback arm
// enforces it carefully; the exact arm forwarded whatever PriceDetailed reported for a model the catalog
// KNOWS, and an operator override registers a model by name with no price at all — so ResolveRates did
// have a zero outcome, and reported it as `exact`. Both arms enforce the invariant now (see unpriced),
// and it is measured from the money path and the drift detector, not asserted here.

// Rates is a model's per-1M-token prices. It is only ever produced by ResolveRates, and never with
// zero values — see the package invariant above.

// Purpose selects WHICH bound an unknown model falls back to, because "conservative" points in

//
//   - A HOLD is refundable. Holding too much costs the customer nothing permanently (the settle
//     refunds the difference) while holding too little leaks the sub-budget ceiling. So a hold falls
//     back HIGH — the provider's most expensive known model.
//   - A CHARGE is final. Charging too much is an over-bill on a rate we admittedly guessed, which is
//     the one outcome that is indefensible to a customer. So a charge falls back LOW — the provider's
//     cheapest known model, a floor we can defend line by line.
//
// This asymmetry is the same one the reservation seam already runs on: hold an output-aware upper
// bound, charge what was delivered, clamp the charge to the hold.

// unpriced reports whether a catalog entry carries no price at all — which is a model the catalog knows
// the NAME of and not the COST of, and is therefore an unknown for every purpose this file serves.
//
// ⚠ IT IS "BOTH", NEVER "EITHER", AND THAT IS LOAD-BEARING. Three seeded models (text-embedding-3-small,
// -3-large, ada-002) carry OutputPer1M == 0 as their PUBLISHED price: embeddings emit no output tokens, so
// billing any is wrong. An either-rate rule would reprice every embeddings request in production onto a
// fallback. Measured over all 45 seeded models: three have a zero OUTPUT rate, NONE has both zero — so the
// only population this predicate can reach is an operator override, and no shipped model changes.
//
// ⚠ WHY AN OVERRIDE ARRIVES PRICELESS, AND WHY IT IS THE LIKELY CASE RATHER THAN THE EXOTIC ONE: the
// remedy WarnUnpricedModel prints on every unpriced request is "add the model NOW via
// LENS_MODEL_CATALOG_OVERRIDES". That JSON is decoded without DisallowUnknownFields, so omitting the price
// fields — or mistyping input_per_1m as inputPer1M — registers the model with 0.00 and no error. Before the
// operator followed the advice the request billed a defensible floor, loudly, with a metric and a drift
// finding. Without this predicate, following it billed ZERO, silently, reported as `exact`.
//
// Zero-means-unset is this package's existing reading of a zero rate, not a new one: PriceDetailed already
// treats a zero cache rate as "unset" and falls it back to the input rate ("never free"), and fallbackRates
// already refuses to let a zero-priced entry anchor a bound. This applies the same rule to the exact arm.
//
// The consequence is deliberately LOUD, not silent: an unpriced override now takes the fallback arm, so it
// bills a real floor, emits WarnUnpricedModel's ERROR + metric on every request, and reappears in
// modelwatch's drift findings. An operator who genuinely meant "free" learns so on the first request.
