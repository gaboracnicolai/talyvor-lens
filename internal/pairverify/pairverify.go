// Package pairverify is B9.2's pair verifier. Given a candidate pooled match — the question that
// was stored and the question being asked — it asks a small model whether the two have exactly the
// same correct answer, and allows the serve only on an unambiguous YES.
//
// ⚠ IT LOOKS AT THE PAIR, which is what every earlier mechanism could not do. Similarity,
// typographic folding, canonicalisation and doc2query each compared ONE question to a stored key,
// and the danger — direction and negation, "enable" vs "disable" — lives in the difference between
// two questions, not in either alone.
//
// B9.2 allowed wiring only if the committed danger corpus is served ZERO times across three runs;
// cmd/pairverify is the measurement, docs/pool-b92-measured.md the result. B9.7 wired it: the pooled
// semantic read (cache.SemanticCache.GetPooled) serves only on its YES — docs/pool-b97-measured.md.

Question A: %s
Question B: %s

Would these two questions have exactly the same correct answer?
Any difference that could change the answer means NO: direction (enable/disable, to/from, increase/decrease), negation, a version, number, unit, date, place, person, product or other entity. Only a rewording of the same request means YES.

// StandalonePrompt is B16.2's check for a question asked MID-CONVERSATION: would its correct reply
// be the same had the conversation never happened? It is asked WITHOUT the stored question on
// purpose, and as a counterfactual — both measured on 27 Sep with claude-haiku-4-5 (docs/b162-
// standalone-answer-measured.md): one prompt judging "stands alone" and "same answer as Question A"
// together served 10 of 30 context-dependent traps (shown "and what about France?" twice, it judged
// the identical pair, not the conversation), and "could it be answered by someone who has not seen
// the conversation?" still served "how do I say hello?" after "I'm learning Spanish". The pair check
// (Prompt) stays a separate call. %s, %s = the conversation before the message, the message.
const StandalonePrompt = `Below is a conversation and the user's next message.

Conversation:
%s

Next message: %s

Would the correct reply to the next message be exactly the same if the conversation above had never happened?
Think about what the conversation establishes: a topic, something the user is learning or doing, a place, a language, a person or thing that "it", "that", "he", "there" or "the same" refers to, an instruction about format, length or tone, a preference or a personal detail. If any of it changes what the right reply is, the answer is NO.
Answer YES only if someone who never saw the conversation would give exactly the right reply.
