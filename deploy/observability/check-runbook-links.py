"""check-runbook-links.py — the by-hand network probe for the runbook links in alerts.yaml.

WHY THIS IS NOT A GO TEST. `go test` would then depend on github.com being reachable, and no
talyvor-lens CI job has network guarantees to it. So the split is the same one
`deploy/helm/lens/check-image-reach.py` uses for images:

  · cmd/lens/runbook_link_reach_test.go, OFFLINE, runs in CI: the URL prefix is a hardcoded
    literal and every target must exist in this repo.
  · THIS SCRIPT, by hand: the real HTTP probe that says whether that literal is still right.

CONTROLS, BOTH DIRECTIONS — a probe that reports 200 for everything is not a probe:

  · POSITIVE   each of the six live URLs must return 200.
  · NEGATIVE   a filename that does not exist, under the SAME repo, must return 404. Without this,
               a repo-level redirect or a soft-404 would make every row above meaningless.
  · NEGATIVE   the old `talyvor/lens` URL must still 404 — that is the defect this fixed.
  · NEGATIVE   `gaboracnicolai/lens` — the ORG-ONLY correction — must 404 too. It was written down
               that only the org was wrong. It was not: the repository is `talyvor-lens`, and a
               half-correction is another 404 one path segment later.

Usage:  python3 deploy/observability/check-runbook-links.py
Exit 0 iff every row matches its expected status.
