"""Does every image this chart renders resolve to an ANONYMOUS puller?

That is what a self-host evaluator running `helm install` is, and until 2026-08-10 the answer for
the default render was NO: the chart named `ghcr.io/talyvor/talyvor-lens:0.1.0`, an organisation
that does not exist on GitHub at all.

⚠ RUN THIS BY HAND, NOT IN CI. It needs `helm` (installed in no talyvor-lens CI job) and it talks
to a live registry, which would make `go test` fail whenever GHCR has a bad day. The offline half
of this guard — values.yaml / Chart.yaml / deploy/k8s/manifests.yaml cross-checked against
.github/workflows/images.yaml — lives in cmd/lens/chart_image_reach_test.go and DOES run in CI.

    python3 deploy/helm/lens/check-image-reach.py               # default render
    python3 deploy/helm/lens/check-image-reach.py --all-opt-ins # + nodes, backup, pgbouncer

⚠ CONTROLLED IN BOTH DIRECTIONS, EVERY RUN, BEFORE ANY ROW IS BELIEVED. A probe that denied
everything would "prove" the chart broken; one that accepted everything would "prove" it fine. So
a known-public image must PASS and a known-absent one must FAIL on the same instrument in the same
run, and the script exits non-zero if a control misbehaves — even when every chart row looks good.

⚠ THE TWO FAILURE MODES ARE DIFFERENT AND THIS SCRIPT KEEPS THEM APART:
    token endpoint 403  — the REPOSITORY is not anonymously pullable (private, or no such owner)
    manifest 404        — the repository IS public and THAT TAG was never published
The chart's old default failed the first way. Correcting only the organisation would have failed
the second way, and a probe reporting one boolean would have called that a fix.
