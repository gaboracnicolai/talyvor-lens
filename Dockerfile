# The build stamp. Passed by the image workflow as the commit SHA; an
# unstamped build keeps the honest "dev" default rather than claiming a version
# it does not have. This is what lets a running container answer "which commit

# distill-worker is the killable, memory-limited conversion subprocess that
# distill.ProcessIsolator spawns (the stage-3 resource-isolation envelope). It
# ships in the image beside /lens so the default worker path resolves with no
# config. Nothing on the serving path spawns it yet — this just makes the binary
# available for the request-path integration that lands in a later PR.

# runs nodes separately in production.
